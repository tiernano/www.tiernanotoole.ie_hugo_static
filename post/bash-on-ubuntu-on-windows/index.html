<p>Microsoft <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">Build 2016</a> is on this week, and there were a lot of interesting developments yesterday, but the one that interested me the most is <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevelopersCanRunBashShellAndUsermodeUbuntuLinuxBinariesOnWindows10.aspx">Bash on Ubuntu on Windows</a>. <a href="http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2016/03/ubuntu-on-windows.html">Dustin from Ubuntu</a> has a more details, and Scott Hanselman has posted <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C906">a technical video</a> about this. This is very interesting, and I CANT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT! But, I do have some questions, which I thought I would put down in blog format:</p>

<ul>
<li>Based on the post by Dustin, it seems that low level Linux calls are being handled and translated to Windows system calls. Which makes me think, could <strong>any</strong> Linux Distro work? Could <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>, <a href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</a> or <a href="http://www.centos.org">Centos</a> work in the same way?</li>
<li>Will this Work on Windows Server 2016 when it launches?</li>
<li>Given that it calling down to a low level, could GUI applications work too?</li>
<li>Shut up and take my money! I WANT IT NOW!</li>
</ul>

<p>So, there are my questions&hellip; This is very cool, and I cannot wait to get my hands on this. Just wondering if this will be available to <a href="https://insider.windows.com/">Windows Insiders</a> sooner, rather than later?</p>
