<p>So, i have a machine on my network, which should be only connecting to the internet though a VPN. I needed to tell my RouterOS box to block all access, except to this said IP address&hellip; The following <em>should</em> do the trick&hellip; YMMV</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/tiernano/3871919.js"></script>

<p>this will drop any packets from the srcaddress (IP address) that are not for destination dstaddress (IP address). in my case, dstaddress is the VPN server i want to connect to. So, in theory, all packets should just go though the VPN and not leak out in to the rest of the network&hellip; again, still testing this so be careful!</p>
