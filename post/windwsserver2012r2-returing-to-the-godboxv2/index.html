<p>After a few months of running <a href="http://www.sabayon.org">Sabayon</a> Linux on the GodboxV2, i am going back to Windows Server. Back around October of last year, i installed Windows 10 Preview on the GodBoxV2, and, well, there where issues with graphics drivers, etc. Then, some time after, i cant remember off hand when, i moved to Sabayon Linux. Its based on <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> but has a lot of the components pre-built. Gentoo is a &ldquo;Build from scratch&rdquo; sort of OS. You get a basic kernel and a basic set of components, but you build everything else from scratch&hellip; including rebuilding the kernel if you want. Sabayon, on the other hand has all that mostly prebuilt, though you can still use Gentoo&rsquo;s <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage">Portage</a> to build stuff yourself.</p>

<p>Anyway, for the last few months, all was going mostly well&hellip; but I miss Windows. And, given i have pretty much always ran a server OS on my main workstations, I am heading back to Server 2012R2. I was tempted by 2016, but its still very early days&hellip; Maybe i will run it as a VM for a while, but we will see&hellip;</p>
