<p>So, something i have been looking into in recient times has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_data_store">Distributed Storage</a>, and, more specifically, how to use the storage in my <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/Computers/">many, many machines</a> to protect data, and also increese my usable space&hellip; There are a few projects on the market that do this (<a href="https://ceph.com/">Ceph</a>, <a href="http://www.noobaa.com/">NooBaa</a> and <a href="https://www.gluster.org/">Gluster</a> all spring to mind) but some are more painful to setup than others&hellip; which brings me nicely to <a href="https://minio.io/">Minio</a>. Minio is a 20ish MB executable you download from their site, mark it as executable (on Linux or Mac Boxes) and run&hellip; and you have yourself a S3 compatable storage server&hellip; Simples!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Wait!&rdquo; i here you screem! &ldquo;thats not distributed!&rdquo;. Well, yes&hellip; but, it can be! Their <a href="http://docs.minio.io/docs/distributed-minio-quickstart-guide">Distributed Quick Start Guide</a>, which is where i started with this, allows you to run a distributed copy of your data. I will let their documentation explain more, but this is what i did:</p>

<ul>
<li>download the minio server (single executable file) on a minimum of 4 machines.</li>
<li>on each machine, run a command like the following:</li>
</ul>

<script src="//gist.github.com/tiernano/a6617921976eef0c1c79b3175bd76bf7.js"></script>

<p>replacing accesskey and secretkey with keys (check minio documentation to get these) and foldertoexport with, well, the folder you want to export!</p>

<p>For me, i have 4 servers currently clustered. 2 are in <a href="http://www.online.net">online.net</a> (one in Paris, one in Amsterdam), 1 in <a href="http://www.ovh.net">OVH.NET</a> (France, somewhere) and one in Dublin (<a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/Computers/GodBoxV2.html">GodBoxV2</a> currently). They are all interconnected using <a href="https://www.zerotier.com/">ZeroTier</a> (I will explain that later) and so far, so good&hellip; only ran some basic tests, but with it, i could loose 2 machines and still have data&hellip; Not bad for free! I will run some speed tests soon.</p>
