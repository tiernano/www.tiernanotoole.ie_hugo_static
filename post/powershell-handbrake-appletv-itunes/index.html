<p>I have an <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv">AppleTV</a> in the house (3, actually) and i am very happy with its ease of use, size and cost&hellip; You cant really argue with the small price!</p>

<p>I also have a lot of content that works great with the AppleTV in iTunes, but i have content which does not work so great with the AppleTV&hellip; So, i needed to find a way to convert files quickly and easily&hellip; thats where PowerShell and <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a> come in&hellip;</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/tiernano/3798509.js"></script>

<ul>
<li>in the code above, you need to set the path of where your files live. in my case they live on a NAS.</li>
<li>next, set the location of HandBrake&hellip; i have a 64 bit copy of Windows, and a 64 bit copy of HandBrake.</li>
<li>set the new file name to where you want the file to go. in my case i have it set to my &ldquo;<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3832">Automatically Add to iTunes</a>&rdquo; folder, which is a magic folder for iTunes that copies any files dropped in there to your iTunes library.</li>
<li>finally, conversion is run&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>This may take a few min, depending on a few factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>how many files you are converting</li>
<li>how fast your machine in</li>
<li>how fast your machine can read and write the files&hellip;</li>
<li>etc&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>I have set files to convert on 3 different machines (the GodBox and 2 other servers) and i am getting speeds of anywhere between 250FPS (on the GodBox running 2 instances of HandBrake CLI) and 40 - 60 FPS on the older servers&hellip; on the remote machines, they are sending files to the GodBox folder also, so once everything completes, its just a matter of opening iTunes and we are good to go&hellip; Now to figure out how to automate the Metadata import&hellip;</p>
