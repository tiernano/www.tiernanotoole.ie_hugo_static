<p>I have been using a <a href="http://www.mikrotik.com">MikroTik</a> <a href="http://routerboard.com/RB750G">RouterBoard RB750</a> for a while now, and i love it! Over the weekend, i upgraded it to a <a href="http://routerboard.com/RB1100">RB1100</a>. Its the same software running the device, but the device is faster (800Mhz PowerPC chip VS MIPS-BE at 680Mhz), has more memory (512Mb upgradable to 1.5Gb vs 32Mb) and more storage (think its 512Mb on board, plus 4Gb MicroSD card vs 32mb&hellip;). It also has more ports (13 GigE VS 5) and 2 Switch Groups, which i have no idea what they do just yet&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyway, part of getting the RB1100 online and taking over from my existing router was getting Dynamic DNS updating. I use both <a href="http://www.dyndns.org">Dyndns</a> and <a href="http://no-ip.com">NoIP</a> for DNS, but I also like the look of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53">Amazon Route 53</a>. For updating NoIP, I am using the Alternitive script from <a href="http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Dynamic_DNS_Update_Script_for_No-IP_DNS">The Mikrotik Wiki</a>. To get this to work with DynDNS, it would just be a matter of chaning the URL you point to&hellip; I am going to write a web script which will sit internally on the network, use that instead of the No-IP url. When that script gets called, i can log the info, update DynDNS, NoIP and Router53 all in one go. I will be posting more about that soon&hellip;</p>

<p>And while we are on the topic of Scripting RouterOS, checkout the <a href="http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Scripts">Mikrotik Script Example Page</a>. Lots of good stuff up there!</p>
