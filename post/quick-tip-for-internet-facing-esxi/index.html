<p>Quick tip for all you with internet facing <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor">VMWare ESXi</a> Hosts. I
have just got my hands on a box on the <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en">Hetzner</a> network (more on
that later) and using their LARA system i installed ESXi on it. All was good, then I tried login in a couple hours later and i kept getting errors about my password being wrong&hellip; So, i tried a few more times,  got pissed off and rebooted the box (had to do a hard reboot, since i couldn&rsquo;t even get in over KVM). I though this was a hardware issue, or a config issue, and left it&hellip; yesterday, i had the console open most of the day, and when looking at something i noticed this:</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t login! So, tip: create a second user account, name it something other than root, give it a secure password and use that to login to your ESXi box. Ideally, your ESXi box should be behind a firewall, but in the case of a dedicated server, that may not be financially feasible&hellip; Hope this helps someone!</p>
