<p>After my <a href="http://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2013/05/29/RaspberryPi_Astrisk_Box.html">post</a> about the Raspberry Pi acting as a VoIP server, and being able to add a 3G Dongle and allowing it to act as a Mobile Phone gateway, it got me thinking&hellip; Why not have something that allows you to rent a mobile phone number in a country, send and recieve text messages, phone calls, etc, all from anywhere in the world? Thats where <a href="http://www.mpaas.co">Mobile Phone as a Service</a> comes in&hellip;</p>

<p>The theory behing <a href="http://www.mpaas.co">MPaaS</a> is quite simple: A SIM Card for a mobile phone is placed in a USB Dongle, plugged into a VoIP server (Asterisk box, probably a Raspberry Pi) and shared with the user who requests it.</p>

<p>Its only a theory at the moment&hellip; Any interest?</p>
