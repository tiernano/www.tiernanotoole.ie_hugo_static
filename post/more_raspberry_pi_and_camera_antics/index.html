<p>A while back I <a href="http://tiernanotoole.ie/2012/09/06/Rasberry-Stuff.html">posted</a> about the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, and in the post was a link to a Photographer who was <a href="http://davidhunt.ie/?p=2641">embeding a Raspberry Pi into a Canon 5D MKII battery grip</a>. Well, its been a while, and i have been thinking about the Pi and Cameras, so I went looking around&hellip; Here is what i found.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://islandinthenet.com/2012/08/23/hdr-photography-with-raspberry-pi-and-gphoto2/">HDR Photography with a Raspberry Pi and GPhoto2</a>: It was linked at the end of David&rsquo;s post, and i missed it completely. David mentions he was using <a href="http://gphoto.org/proj/gphoto2/">GPhoto2</a> to take photos from the Pi, so its a good place to start.</li>
<li><a href="http://skowron.biz/artikel/gphoto-raspberry/">GPhoto2 and the Raspberry Pi</a>: starters guide on getting the Pi to talk to your Camera.</li>
<li>Not specifically Pi+Camera released, but the <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/">Stackoverflow Raspberry Pi Page</a> is a handy resource for asking questions&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>The one thing i have not been able to figure out is how to tell the Pi to take the photos out of the camera <strong>wihtout having a monitor plugged in</strong>. I was thinking either tell it, on boot, to start monitoring the camera and download everything. This way, if you have it plugged into a external power source, it will be monitoring and downloading to somewhere&hellip; USB HDD, USB Key, etc. If there is a Wifi spot around, try uploading them to a location, posibily manageable via web interface of some sort&hellip; Lots of interesting ideas can be done&hellip; its just a matter of doing them&hellip; :)</p>
