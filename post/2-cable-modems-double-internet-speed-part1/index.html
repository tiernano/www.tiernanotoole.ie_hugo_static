      <p>[NOTE] This part 1 in a series of posts. The rest can be found <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/tag/Double_Internet/">here</a>.</p>

<p>First, a bit of background, and then I will explain what I am currently running in <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2016/03/30/mptcp-ssh-squid-openvpn-double-speed-part-2.html">Part 2</a>&hellip;</p>

<p>For the last 15 or so years, I have had at least 2 internet connections in to the house&hellip; 2 of them have always been Cable Modems from NTL, which became UPC, and now is <a href="http://www.virginmedia.ie">Virgin Media</a>. When I started, i think the modems where 150/50kbit/s and 600/150kb/s, and have steadily increased in speed, currently at 360/36Mbit/s each&hellip; But they have always been somewhat separate, and single thread downloads have always been limited to 1 of the connections&hellip; I have been looking for ways around this for years&hellip;</p>

<p>It started with a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/rv042-dual-wan-vpn-router/index.html">Linksys RV042 router</a> which allowed me to load balance my connections&hellip; At the time, and i cant even remember when this was, my total bandwidth would not exceed the router. The RV042 has 2 10/100mbit WAN links and 4 100mb/s LAN links&hellip;So, when the connection bandwidth increased, I moved to a new router&hellip;</p>

<p>The next router vendor i tried was <a href="http://www.mikrotik.com">Mikrotik</a>. I tried a few different options, including an <a href="http://routerboard.com/RB1100">RB1100</a> and running their <a href="http://www.mikrotik.com/software">RouterOS</a> on x86 hardware&hellip; Both worked, well, ok, and the <a href="http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Load_Balancing#Nth">Load balancing with nth</a> stuff did do what i needed, along with other stuff, like routing traffic destined for some sites (like BBC iPlayer) to go over a VPN. But in the end, hardware issues and performance problems with the x86 machine (Mikrotik at the time was limited to 2GB of RAM on x86 hardware) I ended up at <a href="http://www.pfsense.org">PfSense</a>.</p>

<p>PfSense was installed on the same hardware, a HP ProLiant ML110 G5 with 8GB RAM, a Core2Quad processor and 12 GigE Network cards&hellip; And, on PfSense, things were good&hellip; Performance was stable, load balancing worked as expected, I could set some traffic to go over certain links, etc. all was good&hellip; But I lacked IPv6&hellip; Plus, the HP used a LOT of power&hellip;</p>

<p>The current instalment of my network uses a <a href="http://www.ubnt.com">Ubiquiti Networks</a> <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-poe/">Edge Router POE</a>. To show the difference in power, check out the graphs from my <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/mfi/mpower/">Ubnt MPower</a> device. ProLiant first, EdgeRouter second:</p>


<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/tiernanotoole/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/20150916-proliant-power-usage.PNG"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tiernanotoole/image/upload/w_500,q_auto,f_auto/20150916-proliant-power-usage.PNG" alt=""></a>




<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/tiernanotoole/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/20150916-edgerouter-power-usage.PNG"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tiernanotoole/image/upload/w_500,q_auto,f_auto/20150916-edgerouter-power-usage.PNG" alt=""></a>



<p>Plus, the EdgeRouter does not produce as much heat, and its a LOT smaller that the PowerEdge! It does all the same things I could get PfSense to do, in a lot smaller package (I could, in theory, get a smaller box for PfSense).</p>

<p>So, where does that leave us? Well, I now have 720Mbit/s down and 72Mbit/s up, if I can do multiple threads for uploading&hellip; But what if I don&rsquo;t? What&rsquo;s next? Well, in the second post, I will explain what I have been trying to do in resent weeks, and what I can do now&hellip;</p>
