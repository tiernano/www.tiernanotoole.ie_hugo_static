<p>So, as you probably know, this site is built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a Static Site Generator, basically taking an input of a load of text files (see the source repo for this site on <a href="https://github.com/tiernano/www.tiernanotoole.ie/">Github here</a>) and generating a load more HTML (the static HTML is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/tiernano/www.tiernanotoole.ie-static">Github here</a>, which auto publishes to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/">Azure App Service</a>).</p>

<p>In previous posts, i have talked about using the likes of <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2017/05/06/vscode-with-powershell.html">Visual Studio Code and Mark Down Monster</a> to build the site. Well, a few days back, i found <a href="https://forestry.io">Forestry.io</a>. Its a web application which, in my case, is linked with my <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> repo (the Jekyll source one) and allows me to make changes to the code easily. Because the way i build my site is a little different, i manually build the site and push to the destination GitHub project, but they have features allowing you to push directly to SFTP or FTP servers, GitHub, or some other options.</p>

<p>The interface is nice and easy to use, and you can use drafts, etc. Mind you, even with drafts, because files are written into a public repo, they are not fully private&hellip; I suppose I could just make the source repo private&hellip; Anyway, they are free for single user sites (like this) or they have paid plans for teams (say, your business blog with more than 1 user updating it, for example).</p>
