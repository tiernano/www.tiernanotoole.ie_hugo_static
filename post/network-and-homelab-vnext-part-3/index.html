<p>So, this part of my article set will be talking specifically about the router and wireless network. At the moment, my router is way overkill:</p>

<ul>
<li>Old HP Proliant ML110 G5</li>
<li><a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/29765/Intel-Core2-Quad-Processor-Q6600-8M-Cache-2_40-GHz-1066-MHz-FSB?q=Q6600">Intel Core2Quad Q6600</a></li>
<li>8 Gb RAM</li>
<li>total of 12 Gigabit network cards (of which 4 are currently used&hellip;)</li>
<li>500Gb HDD</li>
</ul>

<p>I have been playing with some networking in the house and have managed to build some VLANs. The modems are connected both directly to the Router
and to a dedicated switch port for a given VLAN. The plan for the upgrade, which i hope to complete sooner than the rest of the network is as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>get the ML110 running <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor">ESXi</a> and visualize <a href="http://www.pfsense.org">PFSense</a>. Give it 2gb of RAM and some processor.</li>
<li>take some of the network cards out of the box. It does not need 12 ports, but maybe leave the 2 quad ports in there. They should be connected
to the main switch trunked. 8 may be overkill, but i never do things by half.</li>
<li>the PFSEnse VM should be connected to all 3 WAN VlANs (900, 901 and 902) and should also have at least one port to the LAN. There may also be
other ports for other internal VLANs.</li>
</ul>

<p>with the spare processor, i can then add other (small) VMs to this machine.</p>
