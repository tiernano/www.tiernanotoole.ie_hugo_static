<p>A couple months back, I got my hands on a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, a tiny development board that can run a full copy of Linux, has a HDMI port, a couple USB ports, Ethernet and a few other little bits and pieces. The full specs, from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Wikipedia Article</a> are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operating system: Linux (Debian GNU/Linux, Fedora, and Arch Linux ARM)</li>
<li>Power: 2.5 W (model A), 3.5 W (model B)</li>
<li>CPU: ARM1176JZF-S (armv6k) 700 MHz</li>
<li>Storage capacity: SD card slot (SD or SDHC card)</li>
<li>Memory: 256 MByte</li>
<li>Graphics: Broadcom VideoCore IV</li>
</ul>

<p>There have been a few things i have wanted to play with it for, but have not implemented all them yet&hellip; still learning&hellip; but some interesting projects have come to my attention&hellip; here they are, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://davidhunt.ie/?p=2641">Raspberry Pi embedded into a Canon 5D MKII Battery Grip</a>: The idea of this is epic! the possibilities are endless&hellip; GPS, Wifi, FTP, Processing RAW images (ok, maybe not with a 700Mhz processor&hellip;), auto upload to the internet, auto add watermark, resize images before upload, send to iPad&hellip; I could go on and on&hellip;. :)</li>
<li><a href="http://liliputing.com/2012/08/raspberry-pi-mini-pc-crammed-into-a-keyboard.html">Embedding a Raspberry Pi into a Keyboard</a>: this is pretty cool too&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=12017&amp;p=129471#p129471">Quick setup of a Web Server on the Raspberry PI</a>: Install Apache, SSH, PHP, MySQL and an FTP server, all on your Pi!</li>
</ul>

<p>In all fairness, the Pi makes a lot of ideas possible. with such a small size, and such a cheap price ($25-35), you are only limited by your imagination&hellip; Wonder could i get Windows 8 installed on one of these&hellip;</p>

<p>there are also a few interesting things that may make the Pi work more portable&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/lipo-rider-pro-p-992.html?cPath=155">LiPo Rider Pro</a>: takes input from Batteries and Solar Panels and outputs as USB 5V. should run the Pi off solar and batteries for a while&hellip; :)</li>
</ul>
