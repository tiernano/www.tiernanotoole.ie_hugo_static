<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a pretty amazing peice of kit for its price and size. And now, you can make it even more amazing by using it as a VoIP server for your house!</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.raspberry-asterisk.org/">Raspberry Asterisk</a> for downloads, documentation, etc, on how to setup a Raspberry Pi and <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a>. I have a couple Pi&rsquo;s in the house, and plan on setting this up in the next few days. Keep your eyes on the site&hellip; more posts coming!</p>

<p>Also, as an added bonus: You can now use a 3G/HSDPA modem to make and recieve calls using Asterisk and your Pi! <a href="http://blog.carrier-connect.com/raspberry-gsm-gateway/">Carrier Connect</a> has details of how they setup a couple of Raspberry Pi devices in Germany and Cambodia and anyone ringing from Germany got redirected to Cambodia, with no noticable issue. Very cool stuff! Have to try this!</p>

<p>Double Bonous: Chan-Dongle (the software that you use to make and recieve calls with GSM) also allows the <a href="http://wiki.e1550.mobi/doku.php?id=usage#receive_sms_and_ussd">device to accept SMS messages</a>!</p>
