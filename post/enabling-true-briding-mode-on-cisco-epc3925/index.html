<p>I am a <a href="http://www.upc.ie/">UPC Ireland</a> customer, and have 2 cable modems into the house, both Cisco EPC3925s. These are not exactly great modems for power users, but are grand for normal use&hellip; Me, however, being a poweruser wanted something a little more, how should I put it, powerful.</p>

<p>A couple of months back, a tutorial was posted on <a href="http://www.boards.ie">Boards.ie</a> which showed you <a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=79448674">How to enable &ldquo;bridging&rdquo; on your UPC modem</a>. When i say &ldquo;Bridging&rdquo;, they used DMZ, turned off firewalls, static IPs internally, turned off Wifi and DHCP, etc. It worked, quite well actually, but was &ldquo;odd&rdquo;&hellip; Today, however, there is a new tutorial <a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2056758726">Enabling REAL bridging on a Cisco EPC3925</a>. I have tried this, and so far, it works! now just to set my router to work correctly, and update my IPs if they change&hellip;</p>
