<p>I am in the process of moving my Email domains from one <a href="http://www.office365.com">Office365</a> plan (a Professional) to an Enterprise Plan. During the move, i set up some Email Aliases for older email addresses, which are still being used, but i dont send a lot of email from. But if i do need to send emails from these addresses, with the help of Powershell, I managed to set it up. The full details are listed on <a href="https://www.cogmotive.com/blog/office-365-tips/send-as-an-alias-in-microsoft-office-365">&ldquo;how to send as an alias in Office 365&rdquo;</a>. It works perfectly! And, as a bit of shamless self promotion, if you are interested in Office365, why not drop me a mail at Tiernan at LimitedSlipNetworks dot com and i can set you up with a trial and more information.</p>
