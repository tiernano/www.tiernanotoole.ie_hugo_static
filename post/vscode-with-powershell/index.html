<p>A few years back, i created a post showing you how to add an Alias to PowerShell <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2012/08/30/SublimeText-With-Powershell.html">to easily start Sublime Text from a PowerShell command line</a> . This worked well, but this is 2017 (that post is from 2012!) and my daily text editor has changed. I have moved to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> for most of my daily work. It works well 95% of the time. I still use <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/">Visual Studio Pro</a> for C# Development, but for quick fixes and work on, say <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> or smaller edits, Code is great. For blogging, on the other hand, I am trying out <a href="https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/">MarkDown Monster</a> but code still has some nice features. We will see how tests go.</p>

<p>Anyway, to upgrade the post, and to be able to use VS Code and MarkDown Monster from your PowerShell command line, I added the following:</p>

<pre><code>Set-Alias code &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe&quot;
Set-Alias mm &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Markdown Monster\MarkdownMonster.exe&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>You can either run this each time you open PowerShell (a bit of pain) or you can add it to your <code>Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</code> which lives in your <code>Document\WindowsPowerShell</code> folder. If you dont have one, just create the file, add that piece of text, and next time you open PowerShell, you are good to go.</p>

<p>In my case, i am actually in the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders">Visual Studio Code Insiders</a> group, so my alias is:</p>

<pre><code>Set-Alias code &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\Code - Insiders.exe&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>When these are set (and you have restarted your PowerShell windows), you can now run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>code filename.txt
code folder
mm filename.txt
</code></pre>

<p>VSCode will open either files or folders, but it seems Markdown Monster only opens files.</p>
