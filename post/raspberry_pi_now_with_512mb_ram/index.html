<p>Earlier on today, the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced that the Model B will now be <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2180">shipping with 512Mb RAM as standard</a>, with no price change. I posted the link up on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4654251">Hacker News</a> and its caused quite a lot of happy people!</p>

<p>So, with the news of extra RAM, its started making me think of more things the Pi could be used for&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>An Austrian hosting company <a href="https://www.edis.at/en/server/colocation/austria/raspberrypi/">are offering free Co-Location for Raspberry Pis</a> with a 100Mb/s uplink and 100Gb bandwidth! FREE! with 512Mb RAM (or even 256Mb RAM) thats enough for a small site. or even a medium site (like this one) running statically.</li>
<li>Since the <a href="http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/07/3g-internet-on-raspberry-pi-success/">Pi can connect to the internet using 3G</a>, you could install a copy of <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a> and use an SSH tunnel back to your main office or home, have have multiple levels of caching going on&hellip; It would also secure your browsing.</li>
<li><a href="http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/06/raspberry-pi-python-and-3g-dongles-oh-my/">Sending SMS messages though the Raspberry Pi</a> could be useful for sending diagnostic info if the device is remote&hellip;</li>
<li>[XBMC on the Raspberry Pi] would make your media center a lot smaller, use less power, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>just a note on the idea of using 3G and Squid for the Pi&hellip; This is something i am interested in, so its something i want to start playing with. The idea would be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a linux box in house with Squid and SSH enabled, and port forward SSH to the linux box.</li>
<li>tell the pi, on boot, to try and connect to a 3G connection.</li>
<li>once connection is live, connect to SSH tunnel</li>
<li>Squid should already be configued to load and use the upstream Squid box as an upstream cache</li>
<li>local squid should use some storage on either USB or SD for local cache</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, using something like <a href="http://wanproxy.org/">WANProxy</a> on both ends should make things faster also&hellip; Having the Pi, a 3G modem, USB key (optional) and a battery pack, all in a small box, with a Wifi Adapter, should give you a faster mobile internet connection&hellip; And if you could get 2 or more 3G modems (using a Powered USB Hub of some sort), you could do load balancing&hellip;</p>
