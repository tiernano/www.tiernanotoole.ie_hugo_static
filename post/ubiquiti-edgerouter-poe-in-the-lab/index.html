<p>Today, my <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-poe/">Ubiquiti EdgeRouter POE</a> arrived in the house. I got it hooked up to both UPC connections (as secondary connections) and all seems to be working grand. Some notes i wanted to put up here:</p>

<ul>
<li>out of the box, the install was quite simple. set my Ethernet connection to a static ip in the 192.168.1.x/24 range,
using 192.168.1.1 as gateway and dns, and then point at <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> for admin. login (ubit for both username and
password) and heay presto. I was asked did i agree to the license, and then im in.</li>
<li>by default, NAT is off&hellip; i turned it on, and enabled DNS and was able to surf.</li>
<li>I also noticed the software was out of date&hellip; Oddly, there did not seem to be an option to update automatically, but
you can manually download the tar and upload it, which i did.</li>
<li>so far, so good&hellip; not sure yet if i will be using it as my main router, but it may end up being a VoIP router.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, speed test result below:</p>
