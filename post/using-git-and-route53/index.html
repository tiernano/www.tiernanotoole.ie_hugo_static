<p>so, earlier on today, i was talking about using <a href="http://tiernanotoole.ie/2015/05/07/git-push-dns.html">Git with a DNS service called LuaDNS</a> to update your DNS records. Well, thing is, i have 30+ domains registered, and of them about 25 are hosted on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53">Amazon&rsquo;s Route53</a>. So, moving ALL of them seems, well at the moment, excessive&hellip; So, i went digging&hellip;</p>

<p>there is a tool called <a href="https://github.com/barnybug/cli53">cli53</a> which will allow you to manage route53 objects from the command line. It can also export your zones to BIND format and then re-import them if you have made changes&hellip; This all came out of a blog post by the guys and gals at <a href="https://netguru.co/blog/ci-your-dns-setup">netguru</a> who showed how they integrate their DNS records with their Continuous Integration&hellip; Now, i have not gotten to that stage, just yet, but its only 1 step more down the road&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t have my zones in bind format&hellip; So, how do i do that?</p>

<p>I tweaked their block of ruby code (first time playing with ruby, be gentle with me) and got the following:</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/tiernano/f11fbec2075b8bf19d57.js"></script>

<p>essentially, it runs cli53 (you may need to change your path) and then creates .bind files for each zone.</p>

<p>then, using their code below, you can re-import them to Route53:</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/madsheep/7249547.js"></script>

<p>i have exported all mine, added them to git and done some testing&hellip; All seems to be in order&hellip; once i do some tweaks, i can get that CI piece working and it should be all magic&hellip;</p>
