<p>I have been using an <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-poe/">EdgeRouer POE</a> as my main router for most of the network (some of the network still uses <a href="http://www.pfsense.org">PFSense</a> as a router, but thats being removed soon) for the last few weeks, and i am quite happy with it. I also have a second router, a <a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/unified-threat-management.aspx">Sophos UTM</a> VM between my first LAN (essentially a DMZ) and my client LAN (there will be more &ldquo;LANs&rdquo; over there soon). The Client LAN is NATed between the DMZ and the LAN, which means anything on the LAN i want to access from the DMZ has to be port forwarded&hellip; Ideally, not much from the LAN should be accessible though the DMZ, but in my initial setup, stuff like <a href="http://www.plex.tv">Plex</a>, etc, is&hellip;</p>

<p>What i wanted to do was setup a proper firewall between both networks, without the use of NAT&hellip; Do do this, i first had to disable th masquerading rules in Sophos:</p>

<p>next, on the EdgeRouter, i added a static route to point at the new network:</p>

<p>And finally, under firewall rules, i allowed what i wanted to allow (in this case, SSH from any DMZ client (not advised) to my Mac Mini).</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is that! So far, so good!</p>
