<p>Couple of bits and pieces on Jekyll stuff today&hellip; I am tweaking the outline of the site, so i am surfing around finding stuff&hellip; here is what i have found</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.layouts-the.me/2011/03/16/hosting-on-amazon-s3/">Host a static site on Amazon S3</a>: Interesting idea, and something i would look into eventually&hellip; And with the help of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront">CloudFront</a> you could host your whole blog on a CDN!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.layouts-the.me/rake/2011/04/23/rake_tasks_for_jekyll/">Rake tasks for Jekyll</a>: Rake is the Ruby version of make&hellip; and a RakeFile can have tasks, which are in Ruby&hellip; They can do, from what i can gather, pretty much anything&hellip; So, some examples of what you can do with them are linked here&hellip; I especially like the New Post generator&hellip; very handy!</li>
<li><a href="http://recursive-design.com/projects/jekyll-plugins/">Jekyll Plugins</a>: Various different plugins for Jekyll&hellip; I am interested in a few of these, mainly the Generate_projects one, which generates a page for your projects based on your <a href="http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/">GitHub</a> projects&hellip; very cool stuff&hellip;</li>
<li>Strictly speaking, this is not just a Jekyll how to, but <a href="http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/">Migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll</a> is a handy read. my <a href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net">main blog</a>, <a href="http://podcast.tiernanotoole.ie">my podcast</a> and <a href="http://geekphotographer.com">photography blog</a> both run WordPress. migrating them to Jekyll would mean i could move them directly to a CDN and make things a lot faster&hellip; Maybe something i plan doing soon&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any tips or tricks, why not leave a comment and i can add them to the post.</p>
