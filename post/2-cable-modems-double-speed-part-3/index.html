<p>[NOTE] This part 3 in a series of posts. The rest can be found <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/tag/Double_Internet/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2016/03/22/2-Cable-Modems-Double-Internet-Speed-part1.html">Part 1 of this series</a> I explained the why and what I wanted to do for this &ldquo;project&rdquo;. In <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2016/03/30/mptcp-ssh-squid-openvpn-double-speed-part-2.html">Part 2</a> I did some basic testing of both <a href="http://www.multipath-tcp.org">MPTCP</a> and <a href="http://zehome.github.io/MLVPN">MLVPN</a>. I also mentioned trying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol#PPP_Configuration_Options">MMPPP</a> using <a href="http://vtun.sourceforge.net/">vtund</a> but it has been a while since I did that testing, and it had not been on bare metal. So, this post is a follow up, where I am using bare metal.</p>

<p>So, first, the setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>ProLiant box is running Debian 8.3 x64, and has both vtund and ppp installed</li>
<li><a href="https://m.do.co/c/d4d345b83b55">Digtial Ocean</a> box also has Debian 8.3, vtund and ppp installed</li>
<li>walked though the guide from <a href="https://johnlewis.ie/bonding-teaming-internet-connections/">John Lewis</a> and made some changes to the configs. the main ones are mentioned below</li>
</ul>

<p>Once done, i installed both iperf and iftop on both boxes, and ran</p>

<pre><code>iperf -s
</code></pre>

<p>on the Digital Ocean box and</p>

<pre><code>iperf -c 192.168.10.1 -d
</code></pre>

<p>on the local box. And, well, the results where not as expected. Pretty poor actually:</p>

<p>First, using Squid installed on the DO box, i tried using WGET to download a file using it. If I did this on the DO box itself, i was getting 100MBytes/s&hellip; When I ran it over the MLPPP box, well, under 7 was achieved.</p>

<p>Then i though it might have been Squid. So, since the file had been downloaded to DO, i SFTPed into the box over the MLPPP link, and tried again&hellip; Again, pretty poor result. I think i seen it hit about 7MB a sec at one stage.</p>

<p>Here is what is showing on the DO box when running the SFTP download. You can see 2 connections from the 2 WAN links at home hitting the box, and they are balanced. Its just nowhere near the speed they are capable of.</p>

<p>I did not get a screen shot of this, but when I tried with iperf, thinking it might have been overhead of SFTP or Squid, I was getting results matching what I was seeing with SFTP. Downloads in the 55-60mbit/s range for download and 40ish for upload. 40 is still faster than 1 link, mind you&hellip;</p>

<p>I mentioned that I had made some minor tweaks to the configs from what John had written. Well, mostly it was config changes to how routing was done. In Johns case, he is bonding a DSL and a HSDPA connection, so he had setup to do for logging into his PPP modem and connecting. Also, when he setup the interfaces, he routing tables in there. I have mine setup in a single config file, like as follows:</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/tiernano/a9a642c4d029c0dcf8beb926b3588991.js"></script>

<p>I have changed the names from adsl1 and 2 to WAN1 and 2, and the IPs are changed from internal IPs to my public IPs. I manually run this when setting up my connection.</p>

<p>Nothing else on his config files have changed. I did not do any of the masquerading stuff, mainly cause this was testing. I just want a tunnel to start with. When reading the vtund.conf file, you can see that encryption and compression are both turned off, and and the same in the ppp configuration. I also don&rsquo;t think the issue is to do with the CPU performance, since these are the screenshots of top running on both boxes:</p>

<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/tiernanotoole/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/20160402-top-view-client-orig.PNG"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tiernanotoole/image/upload/w_500,q_auto,f_auto/20160402-top-view-client-orig.PNG" alt=""></a>



<p>in both cases, CPU usage is sub 6% for VTUN and SSH seems to be using less than 10%. So, now, I&rsquo;m baffled as to why this is not performing as expected&hellip; More testing required!</p>
