<p><a href="https://hubic.com/home/new/?referral=GMSQVQ">HubiC</a> is an online storage site, built by the guys at <a href="http://www.ovh.com">OVH</a>. They are currently offering 30Gb free (if you use the link above) or if you pay, you get 110Gb (insted of the usual 100Gb) for EUR1 a month, or 10.5TB (yup&hellip; TERABYTES!) for EUR5 a month&hellip; Thats a crazy amount of storage for a not crazy amount of money!</p>

<p>So, while playing around with different things, I found they have an <a href="https://api.hubic.com/">API</a>, so other than the usual apps to play with (like the Hubic Apps for iPhone, Android, Windows Phone, Windows Desktop and OSX, <a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/">Duplicity</a> for backing up *nix boxes, and a few others) you can build your own&hellip;</p>

<p>But first, i needed to figure out how&hellip; So, after a lot of arsing around in Linux shells with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> i finally got some stuff working!</p>

<p>First, i used the <a href="https://api.hubic.com/sandbox/">Hubic sandbox</a> to get the keys&hellip; its quite simple to walk though&hellip; this gets you your Access Token (see step 3). next, we need to get the Endpoint from Hubic: <a href="https://gist.github.com/tiernano/9c061ae8d1312190f152#file-gistfile1-txt">This GIST shows more</a>:</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/tiernano/9c061ae8d1312190f152.js"></script>

<p>Quick walkthough:</p>

<p>the first CURL request is to the HubiC API to get the credentials&hellip; this gives you a JSON response with a token and a endpoint URL aswell with an expire time&hellip;</p>

<p>The next request gets you a list of all files (or at least a load of files in my case) of whats in your folder. the <pre>default</pre> name here is my folder&hellip; I think its what everyone starts out with in HubiC&hellip; if you remove it, you will see all your top level folders.</p>

<p>next request i tried was to upload a file&hellip; the <pre>filename</pre> part is where you want it to be stored. this must exist on your local machine.</p>

<p>finally, downloading of a file&hellip; pass in the location of the file on the server (listing files will give you the location) and then <pre>-o</pre> in curl shows the output location&hellip;</p>

<p>Simples! now to get this working in c#&hellip; <a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">Full OpenStack Swift API is available</a> to show how to do more&hellip; hopefully it will help in my C# coding&hellip;</p>
