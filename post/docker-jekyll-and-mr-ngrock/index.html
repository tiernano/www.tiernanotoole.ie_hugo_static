<p>See what i did with the title?! Anyway, in <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2016/11/02/building-jekyll-sites-with-docker-on-windows.html">my last post</a>, i explained how i was building this site with Docker running on Windows 10 with the Anniversary update. Today, i am going to show you how to host it using <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a> and <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a>.</p>

<p>So, first, you should know what Nginx is at this stage&hellip; If not, check out <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">their site</a>. Next <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> is basically a way of tunneling your localhost to the web. So, how do we build the whole lot together and serve your site to the internet? Well, this is what i have so far:</p>

<p>First, build your site in jekyll. for me, the command is</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm -v &quot;$(pwd):/src&quot; -w /src ruby sh -c 'bundle install --path vendor/bundle &amp;&amp; exec jekyll build -s www.tiernanotoole.ie/ -d www.tiernanotoole.ie/_site/'
</code></pre>

<p>next, run an nginx server with that output folder:</p>

<pre><code>docker run --name tiernanotoolenginx -v &quot;$(pwd)/www.tiernanotoole.ie/_site/:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro&quot; -d -p 8881:80 nginx
</code></pre>

<p>the docker container is called tiernanotoolenginx, since i could have multiple ones, and port 8881 is being redirected to port 80 on that container, but technically, it might not be needed due to the next command:</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm -it --link tiernanotoolenginx wernight/ngrok ngrok http tiernanotoolenginx:80
</code></pre>

<p>essentially, what we are doing here is running ngrok and pointing it at post 80 on the nginx container&hellip; you see i did not point at 8881, since we are using the continer directly&hellip; it might be different if you were not&hellip;</p>

<p>when that command runs, you get a screen telling you the URL of your site with some basic stats. your site is now hosted publically, via an ngrok tunnel! you could run that container as a daemon, and leave it running, but for me, i wanted to do some minor testing, so i can kill it when i want&hellip;</p>

<p>So, all is good with the world!</p>
