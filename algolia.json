It did come with a 18 month contract, but I pulled the trigger and got it as a backup link. I picked this up in the local Three store, and they had a couple of options for modems: a couple of Huawei mobile Wifi hotspots (E5573 or E5577) or a Huawei B525 Modem, which is designed for home use. Alternatively, there was a Sim only option, but given the modem was free with the contact, i went with the B525.\nThe B525 is not a bad router, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, but its a Router\u0026hellip; i already have a few of them, including my Mikrotik RouterBoard CCR1016-12G, an EdgeRouter POE, a Ubiquiti USG 3 and some virtual ones too\u0026hellip; yea, don\u0026rsquo;t ask\u0026hellip; What i wanted was a modem; no WiFi, no routing, and give me a full, non NATted IP to the internet.

Currently, mine is hooked up to the second WAN port of the USG, and is currently serving about 30-40% of the traffic on that network (mostly media devices, IOT stuff, etc). Speed wise, its not bad.\nNot as good as a hardwired connection, but its only getting 4 bars, and its about 1km to the nearest cell tower. I do want to get some external aerials for it, to see if i can boost the download/upload speed, but we will see.

This post will explain what I am using, how I am setting it up, and some other details you might (or might not) find useful.\nFirst, backstory. I have been interested in VoIP for many years. The first post I wrote about Ito this site was here back in 2012, but I had posted about it on my other site back in 2008. It got my attention years ago as a way of saving money on calls, but in recent times, that has changed a little, mainly because most providers gives you calls for free (my mobile and land lines both come with unlimited calls and with my mobile, I can make them anywhere in Europe). The new reason I am interesting in VoIP is consolidation: I currently have 3 mobile phone numbers, at least 1 landline dedicated to me in the house, plus a work landline. I want to be able to pick up any phone and make a call, and it show as coming from my main number. Or a call comes in and i can pick it up from any of my phones\u0026hellip; And that is what i am trying to do here\u0026hellip; I (will) have some of it working, but some parts are still missing\u0026hellip;\nThe parts I have (or will have) working are as follows:\n my land line number in the house is being ported to Virgin Media\u0026rsquo;s VoIP service. So, thats not stuck in an analog world any more! The house phone now has a VoIP adapter allowing the standard analog phone make VoIP Calls   There is a company in the Netherlands called ZeroPlex who have a VoIP over GSM service. Essentially, the SIM they give is connected to your own SIP trunk. You can set it up to allow all calls to go though your SIP trunk, only incoming or only out going. I found their contact though Reddit but they may be able to help if you drop them an email. All VoIP traffic in the house is routed though 3CX.   I have a couple of SIP trunks hooked up to 3CX: Virgin Media, Zeroplex (they redirect the NL number is sent over this, and i can make calls though this trunk too), Twilio, which i use for transient numbers, and Sip Discount which offers really cheap calls. Phone wise, i use a Ubiquiti UVP-Executive desk phone, the SIM card, and the 3CX client on mobile (Either iPhone or Android).  So, all in, Im about 50% of the way there\u0026hellip; As of the time of this post, the SIM is still in the mail and the phone numbers are not ported to Virgin Media\u0026hellip; yet\u0026hellip; Tomorrow they should be, and over the next few days there will be some tweaking to get it working correctly\u0026hellip; I will probably have some updates over the coming week\u0026hellip;\n","tags":["VoIP"],"title":"Finally going all in on VoIP","type":"post","url":"/2018/07/24/finally-going-all-in-on-voip.html","weight":0,"wordcount":490},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1530808823,"description":"","dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":500,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535987202,"objectID":"d955cfffdcb2d9d39655110322084ab0","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2018/07/05/auto-deploying-to-multiple-servers-with-github-and-webhooks.html","publishdate":"2018-07-05T16:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2018/07/05/auto-deploying-to-multiple-servers-with-github-and-webhooks.html","section":"post","summary":"In yesterdays post, i mentioned that i wanted to try get an auto deploy working for this site. It already builds automagically using Forestry and puts the static HTML into a Github repo, but i needed to manually update the servers hosting the site\u0026hellip; Well, not any more!\nusing the magic of Github\u0026rsquo;s Web hooks, the Webhook project and a small piece of bash shell script, i have managed to get this auto deploying\u0026hellip;\nFirst, Download the Webhook project (its a Go application, so it works pretty much anywhere). Copy it somewhere on your machine. Next, you need a config. I used the Github sample config from the project site and made tweaks to what script to run and what i was passing in.\n next, the script to pull from Github was simple enough:\n The repo should already be cloned into the folder, /var/www/localfolder and your web server should be pointing at that also. Then, its just a matter of running the command:\n./webhook --hooks github.json --verbose\nThe --verbose tag gives you lots of info, so its handy for testing. and then your app is running and listening on the default port, 9000.\nnext, head over to your project on Github and go to settings:\nselect webhooks and add new web hook\nFill in the required details on the page, and click save.\nGithub will go out and have a chat with the webhook and verify it can send and recieve stuff from the hook. You can see this in the deliveries section:\nClicking on these will show you the headers that were sent, along with the payload, and you can also see the response from your server. Finally, you have the option of resending the payload, just in case anything goes wrong.\nSo, there you have it. A complete automated deploy across multiple servers! Any questions, leave a comment below!\n[UPDATE] yesterday i mentioned i had to modify the sample that was included on the webhook site. Well, i noticed something this morning. The reason i needed it modified was the trigger rule was checking the header and the reference for the branch, but any time i ran it, it would not trigger\u0026hellip; The reason was simple: the webhook app is expecting application/json but i had it set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded which is the default\u0026hellip; the webhook app then couldn\u0026rsquo;t parse it correctly\u0026hellip; changing that fixes the problem! happy days!\n","tags":["Tutorial","Blogging"],"title":"Auto deploying to multiple servers with GitHub and Webhooks","type":"post","url":"/2018/07/05/auto-deploying-to-multiple-servers-with-github-and-webhooks.html","weight":0,"wordcount":400},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1530724216,"description":"","dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":700,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532428894,"objectID":"529d4fd23d449f615d19af50db87d4d1","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2018/07/04/moving-the-site-to-hugo.html","publishdate":"2018-07-04T17:00:00Z","readingtime":4,"relpermalink":"/2018/07/04/moving-the-site-to-hugo.html","section":"post","summary":"After a LOT of messing with Jekyll, i have finally moved to Hugo! There are a few things that don\u0026rsquo;t fully work yet, and there will be updates to the site soon enough, but for the moment, I am happy\u0026hellip; Its also a LOT faster to build than Jekyll, and less dependencies\u0026hellip; Happy days!\n[update] I though i should probably update this post with a bit more information around hows its built, why i moved to Hugo, and some more links, etc.\nFirst, it is currently being built using Forestry.io. I use it for both editing the documents (mind you i also use VScode for this too) and ii also builds the site now too. I have 2 Github repos. The main code and the Static HTML. When i check into Github, it it sends a webhook to Forestry, which then pulls the latest code and builds the site, and then checks the resulting files into the static HTML repo. Currently its a manual process to get it on to my server. This site is currently hosted on a server in London with my own AS204994 serving the pages. I plan on adding other servers to the list so its proper any-cast, but currently only 1 is running as a web server currently (there are 4 others, if you include the one in the house: 3 in total hosted on Vultr (LON, FRA, NYC) 1 in DevCapsule and then the house) but that is my next challenge\u0026hellip;\nNext question is why? Well, over the last few months, its taking longer and longer to build the site using Jekyll\u0026hellip; Its also getting more painful to maintain, since you have to mess with dependancy hell when updates come out\u0026hellip;\nthen when it finally builds, it takes more than 4 min in most cases\u0026hellip;\nNow, in all fairness, this is building on a clean machine with no bundle caching, and i did have bundle caching at some stage, but its still takes a long enough (30-40 seconds in some cases) to build compared to Hugo:\nthe other big advantage is that Hugo arrives in a single EXE (or other binary format for other platforms) and runs on Windows without any extra stuff to install\u0026hellip; drop the EXE in your path, cd into the folder, and hugo serve and you have a web server running with your files\u0026hellip; if you want to deploy them, run hugo and it builds the project and sticks it in your public folder. Do what you want with it from there! Happy day!\nSo, finally, some links i have found useful while building this site.\n The Hugo Documentation site should be your first point of call\u0026hellip; Lots of handy stuff in there\u0026hellip; Adding Search with Algoia Since the site is static, search doesn\u0026rsquo;t currently work\u0026hellip; but with the help of a hosted service named Algoia you can get around that easily enough\u0026hellip; Turn your static site into a JSON API: I am thinking of tweaking the Computers pages (they stopped working as planned when i moved over) and using a JSON API for it\u0026hellip; Same with the tools list\u0026hellip; Short Codes: Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have a plugin model like Jekyll did\u0026hellip; but there is still a lot of interesting things you can do\u0026hellip; Short codes lets you write custom HTML that gets generated when you put in a particular block of code\u0026hellip; Have a look at the link on the bottom of the page to see the code used to generate this page. Cloudinary: Since moving so static sites, i have found images to be a pain in the ass\u0026hellip; Found these guys the other day, and they integrate well with Forestry. and their free version works grand for smaller sites\u0026hellip;  so, any comments, questions, etc, just leave a message below. and dont forget to subscrbe to the RSS for updates as they come out!\n[UPDATE 2]. So, with the help of Github Webhooks and the webhook project, this site auto deploys to 5 different servers and is currently being served on 4\u0026hellip; Dub is not fully live yet\u0026hellip; happy days!\n[UPDATE 3] as mentioned above, I have the Github Webhooks working.\n","tags":["Blogging"],"title":"Moving the site to Hugo","type":"post","url":"/2018/07/04/moving-the-site-to-hugo.html","weight":0,"wordcount":693},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1530623431,"description":"","dir":"computers/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":300,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535987202,"objectID":"07b9f8c461ed55433791c184785701aa","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/computers/daily-carry.html","publishdate":"2018-07-03T13:10:31Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/computers/daily-carry.html","section":"computers","summary":"A couple of years back, I did a post about my Daily Carry for college\u0026hellip; Well, I have finished (ish) college, but i still cary a lot of weird and wonderful stuff\u0026hellip; So, this is the update\u0026hellip;\nSo, the contents are as follows:\n Microsoft SurfaceBook with an i7 processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB Storage, along with the dGPU.

Essentially, they gave me some credit for their service (i am an existing customer) to play with one of their c2.medium machines. A c2.medium comes with an AMD EPYC 7401P which consists of 24 physical cores clocked at 2Gz with an all core boost at 2.8Gb and a max clock of 3Gz, 48 threads, 64GB ECC Memory, 2x120GB SSDs for boot and 2x480GB SSDs for main storage. It also has a 20Gb network link (2x10gb bonded) and can run pretty much any OS you can think of (Windows is not on the list officially, but you can boot off your own ISO, so you could probably get it on there\u0026hellip; might not be supported, but it might be possible). all this for $1 per hour! And did i mention they are bare metal machines?\nThis was the perfect opportunity to play with the new AMD processors. My current and previoius generation workstations (GodBoxv1 and Godboxv2) are both running Intel Xeon processors. the machine previous to this, the mac pro, is also running a Xeon processor. But previous to both of them, my first 2 major workstations ran AMD\u0026hellip; the first ran 2 AMD Athlon MP processors. These were old school processors that were single core, and i cant even remember their speeds, but i do know there were 32bit only and the machine maxed out at about 1.25GB RAM (well, i had it maxed out at that). the second AMD workstation ran 2 AMD Opterons\u0026hellip; again, single core machines, but this time, they ran 64 bit and IIRC maxed out at 8GB ram. This was a limitation of the board, not the processor\u0026hellip;\nI have been thinking about GodboxV.next, and the AMD processors, specicially the Threadrippers and Epycs, are contenders for the next machine\u0026hellip; so, this test allows me to check them out before i buy!Why would i say no?!\nSo, i spun a box up in New Jersey running Ubuntu 17.10 to play with it, and here are my findings\u0026hellip;\nFirst, i ran lscpu on the box to see what i was playing with:\n I then ran \u0026lsquo;fdisk -l\u0026rsquo; to see what disks i had to play with. on my machine sda and sdb where the 480gb SSDs, sdc was a 120gb that was empty and sdd was the boot drive\u0026hellip; i installed the \u0026lsquo;btrfs-progs\u0026rsquo; and then formatted sda and sdb as a RAID0 array, which i then mounted to /mnt. this gave me just under 900gb to play with\u0026hellip;\nSo, my first test is the usual test: building the Linux Kernel. I know that this is something that the lads at ServeTheHome do a lot but its something i wanted to try my self\u0026hellip; So, first i installed git and build essential, then bison, flex and ncurses-dev, then i cloned Linus\u0026rsquo; git repo at git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git. First things first: this machine has a twin 10gb link, a shead load of cores and some very fast storage. How long did it take to clone? it download 1.02 GiB at 35.32MiB/s (about 30 seconds and about 280Mbit/s) and all in, took 2 min 55 seconds to clone. I then ran time make -j 49 to see how long it would take\u0026hellip; hmmm\u0026hellip; no config file\u0026hellip; make menuconfig and just hit save\u0026hellip; defaults are grand\u0026hellip; time make -j 49 again\u0026hellip; and more errors\u0026hellip; after a bit of googling, i find the page from Ubuntu showing what i need to do to build the kernel. i follow that\u0026hellip; download a LOT more stuff using their instructions, and finally, we get to build\u0026hellip; Time: 6 min 12 seconds\u0026hellip; this is a FULL default build of the kernel\u0026hellip;\nSame build on a VM on GodboxV2 (which was given 32GB RAM and 16 thread, so a full Xeon E5-4620) took 8min 27s to clone (8.18MiB/s. or about 64Mbit/s) and 36 min to build\u0026hellip; yea, that is 3x less cores, 2x less memory, slower storage (This is on Spinny Disk, not SSD), slower network and it is also a VM VS bare metal, still, to be essentially 6 times slower? interesting\u0026hellip; I might, at some stage, boot the machine off a live Linux USB and run some more tests, but not tonight\u0026hellip;\nSo, all this is because i was holding out for the main event\u0026hellip; Photo processing\u0026hellip; I wanted to do something \u0026ldquo;real life\u0026rdquo;, which for me would be development and photo processing\u0026hellip; the kernel build gives an idea of a large project build built, the image processing gives an idea of multimedia work\u0026hellip;\nso, i devised a test: Export a bunch of photos (mix of photos taken on my 5Ds, 5D MKII, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 7Plus) that are stored in light room as full and run them though a basic .NET Core app i wrote. the code for the app is available here. The app fully utilises the machine by using multiple threads, and because its 64 bit, it will use as much memory as it can get its hands on. It just does some basic processing: open the file, resize to 1024X1024 and then save it\u0026hellip; the 1024X1024 part is just a test\u0026hellip; i was a bit under the gun on time, so couldn\u0026rsquo;t spend as much time working on it as i wanted to\u0026hellip;\nIn total, there was 1546 photos exported, and the total file size was 15Gb. First obstacle was to get them uploaded to the Packet machine, which took a while (my upload speed is currently 40Mbit/s)\u0026hellip; Once up, i downloaded a copy of dotnet core 2.0 SDK, cloned the repo with the project, built and ran\u0026hellip; and man, its fast! 4 min 43 seconds. And it used all the cores.\nRunning the same code on GodBoxV2 on the bare metal (no VM this time), i got 17 min 35 seconds of a run\u0026hellip; Now, GodBoxV2 has other things running in the back ground, but not that much\u0026hellip; I also noticed that, on average, photos were being processed in 3-5 seconds on Epyc, but nearly 13-15, and sometimes 20 and 25 seconds on GodBoxV2. I also noticed that on Epyc, the dotnet process took nearly 45GB of RAM\u0026hellip; to run\u0026hellip; On GodBoxV2, it took over 70!\nSo, there you have it. Some starting tests with these processors. I am well impressed with these processors, and would have no issue getting one for the next GodBox\u0026hellip; And with names like Epyc and Threadripper, why not?!\n","tags":["Hardware","Programming","Reviews"],"title":"Playing with AMD's Epyc","type":"post","url":"/2018/07/02/playing-with-amd-epyc.html","weight":0,"wordcount":1083},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1522623306,"description":"","dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":500,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535987202,"objectID":"54dafbfaab5ce9abf9ac3daf2d543499","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2018/04/01/as204994-own-ip-space-and-anycast.html","publishdate":"2018-04-01T23:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2018/04/01/as204994-own-ip-space-and-anycast.html","section":"post","summary":"So, if you are reading this page, it is being delivered with the magic of Anycast\u0026hellip; Well, technically, it was before, since i used Cloudflare, and it still is because of Cloudflare, but also because of my own ASN (As204994), some servers in different locations, and some magic, which i will explain a bit of in this post.\nThis all started late last year when i got my hands on an ASN and a /48 block of IPv6 addresses. I had been reading stuff about BGP, routing, etc, and decided to go all in. it was quite cheap with the help of HostUS. All in, it was about $50 for the year. As part of the process, i needed 2 upstream providers to say they would accept my announcement. They were Hurricane Electric though their Tunnel Broker service, and Vultr using a few of their VPSs.\nAfter i got my space and ASN, i started to announce the V6 addresses over Vultr and Hurricane Electric, and all was good. I had 2 Vultr servers: 1 in London, UK, and one in New Jersey, USA. I had my home machine announce to HE, and then also link to both Vultr servers using Zerotier. All worked well, but due to some family issues, i never got around to putting it into production\u0026hellip; till now.\nThose 3 servers now share an IPv6 address on the loopback port. When you (well, Cloudflare) asks for that IP, the closet (network) with that IP responds, and the NGinx server on that box sends back the contents of the site. This site is hosted on each box, since its fully static, but both AS204994 and TiernanOToole.net are hosted in Ghost, so Dublin (my machine in the house) serves them, and both Lon1 and Nyc1 do proxying. so, most requests from the US are hitting the box in NYC and the ones in Europe share either Dub1 or Lon1. I have some tweaks to do with which servers will be running where, and may add more, but currently its working well.\nSo, how do you figure out what server responded? Simple. Open your Dev tools on your browser, go to network tab, refresh, and see the response headers for anything on this domain.

I got a 10.5\u0026rdquo; with 64GB Storage and the Smart Keyboard. Since then, i have been mostly using it for playing around: watching YouTube, Netflix, surfing on the couch, etc. but i started to wonder how \u0026ldquo;Pro\u0026rdquo; this was\u0026hellip;so i went and did some testing, and in the end nearly all of this post is being written on it\u0026hellip;\nfirst, the good stuff:\n Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Remote Desktop Connection works perfect on the iPad Pro. I have RDPed into machines (with the help of ZeroTier) Panic\u0026rsquo;s Prompt works well too\u0026hellip; again, with ZeroTier, i can SSH into boxes and remote manage them. Handy for checking on docker instances\u0026hellip; Panic also have Coda for iOS. its a very nice (if somewhat expensive at $25) editor for the iPad. This post is being written on there now. for Git stuff, i am using an app called Working Copy. Its free, to an extend, but if you need to do stuff like push changes, which is kind of important, then you need to pay a fee. Coda and Working Copy work together with some magic built into Working Copy. It can act as a WebDav server, which Coda can the connect to. you open, edit, change and create docs, and Working Copy keeps note. then you swap to them and checkin. You need to have both apps on the screen at the same time (the docking feature works well for that) since iOS seems to kill some background tasks. Unrelated to blogging, but i have also tried editing photos using Lightroom, and so far so good. I have used the Apple SD Card adapter to download 50MP photos (upwards of 60MB) from my Canon 5Ds quick enough, add them to Lightroom, make some changes and send them to Twitter, Facebook (not Instagram just yet\u0026hellip;) and it works well. I have managed to hook it to my Gnarbox too.  Bad Stuff?\n keyboard takes a bit of getting used to. the Stupid \u0026ldquo;Global\u0026rdquo; button to swap keyboards (from English to Emoji) is in the place you would expect to find CTRL. and CTRL, Option and Cmd (remember, this is a \u0026ldquo;Mac\u0026rdquo; style keyboard) and all shifted one place\u0026hellip; I would have preferred if they moved that somewhere else, or removed it altogether\u0026hellip; a mouse would be very handy! I have tried pairing a bluetooth mouse to it, and no luck\u0026hellip; it would be handy especially for editing documents and code, since touchscreen is \u0026ldquo;handy\u0026rdquo; some of the time, but not all the time\u0026hellip;  So, there you have it. Blogging on an iPad. Would i give up my daily driver of my Surface Book and GodBoxV2 and just uses an iPad? Hell No\u0026hellip; for basic stuff, it works well. Basic photo editing, blogging, surfing, etc, yes. But there is a reason my workstation has 16 processor cores and 160GB RAM: I need it. I have multiple copies of Visual Studio running, SQL Server, multiple VMs running different tasks, multiple web browsers, multiple monitors, etc. the iPad can do a good chunk of stuff, but not the major stuff\u0026hellip; not yet. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong: Word, Excel, Power Point, Outlook. all the major office tools work grand. But Visual Studio? SQL Management Studio? just not there yet\u0026hellip;\nSo, what did i not do on the iPad, and ended up doing on the PC? Well, so far, nothing\u0026hellip; using Coda and Working Copy, i wrote the text, previewed it and checked it into GitHub. Then, Prompt is being used to build it on my docker box, check into the static site and push, which will then publish. unless you see an update below, all went as planned and all was done on an iPad\u0026hellip;\n","tags":["Blogging","Hardware","Tools"],"title":"Blogging on an iPad Pro","type":"post","url":"/2018/03/06/blogging-on-ipad.html","weight":0,"wordcount":625},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1506322800,"description":"","dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":700,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531466330,"objectID":"a0efa25148b57e6587de0c2afbea8c87","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2017/09/25/new-backup-plans.html","publishdate":"2017-09-25T07:00:00+01:00","readingtime":4,"relpermalink":"/2017/09/25/new-backup-plans.html","section":"post","summary":"So, a few weeks back, CrashPlan, one of my chosen backup services, decided to kill their consumer backup plans. Which made me have to rethink my backup plan for the house\u0026hellip;\nNote: This is how I am backing up files, and may or may not work for you. Some of this is already in \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo; as of today, but others are planned\u0026hellip; Any questions, comments, etc, leave them in the comments.\nSo, first, as mentioned above, CrashPlan\u0026rsquo;s consumer backup options are now dead. They are giving you the option of either upgrading to their Small Business Plan for free till the end of your current contract + 2 months, or moving to Carbonite. For me, i just moved to their Small Business option, since its free, and meant that most of my backups just migrated over\u0026hellip; i did not, how ever, look too much into Carbonite.\nJust checking their site now, i would have to go for a minimum of the Plus plan, and that only allows me to backup 1 machine\u0026hellip; I have 2 (currently) that get backed up\u0026hellip; and probably more at a later date\u0026hellip; and, given their yearly price for Plus is $75 per year, thats $150 for 2 current machines, and an extra $75 per machine after\u0026hellip; Granted, they are saying its unlimited storage. but the extra fee per machine puts it out of contention\u0026hellip;\nFor CrashPlans Small Business Plan, their plan is $10 per machine per month\u0026hellip; So, my 2 machines would cost $240 per year to backup. They are giving me the next few months for free, and then for the first year, they are offering a discount of 75%, but we will see what happens when renewal comes along\u0026hellip;\nSo, where does that leave me? Well, its looking like i will be using a mix of BackBlaze and Hubic. The current idea is as follows:\n GodBoxV2 and the Mac Mini both have Drobos plugged into them: the GodBoxV2 has a Drobo 5D, and the mini has a Drobo mini. There is also a Drobo FS on the network. I know they are not backup solutions, but its better than having stuff on single drives\u0026hellip;\n For Windows boxes, I am backing up files to the cloud using Duplicati. These are backed up to both Hubic and BackBlaze B2. Photos and importing files are backed up to both, and stuff i want backed up, but not in 2 places, is just backed up on Hubic.\n For my Mac mini, i use a a mix of Duplicati and Arq Backup. Arq got B2 support recently, so its very handy for that.\n For some of my Linux Boxes, i use Duplicity. You may need to walk though the steps i have here to get it working with Hubic, and it also works with B2.\n  Some further notes:\n Hubic are charging about EUR5 a month for 10Tb of storage. If you refer people, that can go up. I have maxed mine out at 12.5Tb.\n Hubic is limited to 10mb/s for uploads and downloads. I never got anywhere close to that speed with CrashPlan (I\u0026rsquo;m based in Europe, they are in the US, so speed of light and what have you\u0026hellip; maxed most of the time at 4ish). That being said, even those its \u0026ldquo;limited\u0026rdquo; to 10mb/s, i have seen higher.,.. might be 10 per thread\u0026hellip;\n I did, for a while, use the BackBlaze app and service. I just didn\u0026rsquo;t renew because of the move to B2. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to mess with stuff, their App works great.And if you use this referal link you get a free month\u0026hellip; Also, its FAST AF! it actually manged to max out my upload connection to their server! wont complain about that!\n B2 is cheap. 0.5c per gig stored\u0026hellip; So, it works out at about $5 per TB per month, minus your usual bandwidth fees\u0026hellip;\n Duplicati and Duplicity both have options to send emails on success or failure, or the like. I recommend having the emails on failure turned on at a minimum\u0026hellip; also, on headless boxes, like my Linux box, i recommend checking the backup every week\u0026hellip;\n  So, there we have it.

(@ZeroTier) May 2, 2017  A few people then started asking questions, and looking for a follow up, so here it is\u0026hellip;\nFirst, a quick recap. I had 4 machines, all running Linux. Three of them were in 1 time zone (GMT+1) and one was in another (GMT). Looking at the Distributed Minio Quickstart Guide again, there is a mention of times being in sync\u0026hellip; which is probably why this did not work as planned\u0026hellip; and by \u0026ldquo;not work as planed\u0026rdquo;, I mean that Minio would crash, or not be responsive, or not write data in the place it should have\u0026hellip; which was a pain. But looking at the documentation again, they do mention that Windows support is \u0026ldquo;experimental\u0026rdquo; which means, hopefully, some day it will be not so experimental, and might work\u0026hellip; Given that most of my machines in house are Windows boxes, this would be a nice feature.\nNow, what about ZeroTier? Given they posted it to their twitter? Well, it worked. it did the inter connect stuff well, and, given bandwidth limitations on a home broadband connection, it was still quite fast.\nSo, the question is, how fast? Well, on my Surface Book on a WiFi connection in the house, behind a Meraki MX64 firewall, connecting to the GodBoxV2 over FTP though ZeroTier, i get the following result:\nthe same download over FTP direct (no ZeroTier) does the following:\nSo, direct over FTP is faster\u0026hellip; in this instance by about 70%, but, over the download, it did get slower (seen it hit 12 at one stage) and because its over WiFi, those are a bit wonky\u0026hellip;\nI did get one last screen shot:\nas you can see, the Zerotier network adapter is showing 77.3Mbps, but the main network adapter is showing 80.8Mbps. There would be other traffic there, but if we assume there is nothing but ZeroTier traffic being sent, there is about 5% of an overhead.\nSo, to wrap up: Minio and its distributed storage system over ZeroTier needs more testing. Ideally, all hosts need to be in the same time zone, or at least have the same time\u0026hellip; Will try work on that soon. As for ZeroTier? I am extremely happy with them. Its fast, easy to setup, and easy to configure. What more could you ask for?

It\u0026rsquo;s actually cheaper than the two residential lines i had, but it is also slower than the two combined: previously, it was two x 360/36mb/s. Now i am am on a single 400/40mb/s modem.

Its technically a /29 range, but the first usable IP is given to the modem, which acts as a gateway, so i end up with five usable. Proper business class SLA. Any issues, someone who knows what they are talking about can help Phone lines on a separate modem. So, i got phone lines with them, and they give a separate modem for those lines, so as not to interfere with the internet. that modem has no internet connection and is just for calls. They are also working on a VoIP/SIP offering, which is something i am interested in. Guaranteed speed! They guarantee a minimum speed to the modem at all time. Business customers have a priority on the network, which is nice. And, during testing, so far, i am getting the advertised speed most of the time.

Since then, a few things have changed:\n Amazon have released AWS Workspaces, which is a cloud based desktop using Teradici\u0026rsquo;s PCoIP technology Both EC2 and Azure now have GPU enabled VMs to spin up and use NVidia have released NVidia Grid cards, specifically for the \u0026ldquo;cloud\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;remote\u0026rdquo; desktop services. Windows Continuum now allows you to use your Windows Phone with a keyboard, monitor and mouse, allowing you to replace your desktop. basically, plug your continuum enabled phone into a docking station, and use it as a Windows Desktop. Email, Browsing, Office Apps, etc. anything that supports UWP. and now VMWare has just released a Windows UWP app that works with Continuum  With all the increased bandwidth for mobile devices (4 and 5G, expanding wifi, etc) the idea of having your desktop live in the cloud is getting nearer\u0026hellip; interesting times, my friend\u0026hellip; interesting times\u0026hellip;\n[Update] Thinking a bit more about this, and if this was to work correctly, your phone could be everything required. Get up in the morning, check your emails on your phone, calander items, and news. head off, head to the coffee shop and plug your phone into a \u0026ldquo;laptop\u0026rdquo; style device like a NexDock and catch up on some emails, checking more news sites, etc. When you get into the office, plug your phone into the docking station and Remote Desktop in to your cloud desktop to do your development work, or whatever needs to be done. basic Office apps and Email can be run direct from the phone. When you get home, you can use the Microsoft Wireless Display adapter to watch videos on the big TV, or show web pages.

Even though this is a wind up of the project, there are still new things i have to share.\n I found another project that has potential for speeding up the internet: VTrunkd. after some testing, i does seem to manage to speed up the connection, but either limits on hardware i have in house, or limits of hardware in the cloud, or even the software, stopped me in my tracks\u0026hellip; i did see 400mb/s out of it at one stage, using 200mb/s from each modem\u0026hellip; its close, but its not the full 720\u0026hellip; messing with Quagga/Zebra as mentioned in the previous post has been, well, interesting\u0026hellip; I did manage to get all OVH traffic sent though their server, Digital Ocean traffic sent over that box, and everything else over Hetzner. I added an Azure box to the mix for a while, aswell as a Vultr box, but it got very messey, very quickly. if i had something automated, it would be better. the idea of having a /29 IP range in Hetzner and forwarding it though the tunnels back to the house did work. My Meraki MX64 had one IP address, i had a mail server on a second, everything else on a third, and was planning on using more\u0026hellip; but its just, well, again, messy. So, i will be going back to the idea of 2 IP addresses, and hoping whatever i put infront of the network can figure stuff out\u0026hellip;  So, what am i moving to? well, thats a question\u0026hellip; Currently, i have the Meraki MX64 plugged directly into the modems, and protecting my LAN. So far, so good, but due to hardware limits, it maxes out at around 260mb/s. So, thats out of the question for the main network! I did at one stage have Sophos UTM Home edition running.

I am taking this oppertunity to also write up about the Ubiquiti networks gear in the house also.\n First on the list is my older Ubiquiti Edgerouter POE. It currently in the process of being decommissioned, or used for something else. It was the main edge router for the network: it had both internet connections connected, and did routing, firewalls, etc, but with the Proliant taking over as a router, it is not requried as much any more\u0026hellip; Its still on, mainly because its still a DHCP server, but not much else. There are 2 Meraki MS220-8 switches next. GodBox1 and Godbox2 both connect in here, and are bonded, as is everything else on the network. The MS220-8 has 8 GigE ports, but also has 2 SFP ports. I bought 4 SFP Ethernet adapters and have a short calbe running between the switches. That uplink is also bonded. All going well so far! All meraki hardware can be managed though the meraki dashboard. check out their site for more details and examples of how to use it. I bought one of the MS220\u0026rsquo;s from ebay a few months back, and loved it. Then i realized that you can get your hands on free gear, the MX64, an MS220 and a Wifi Access point if you attend their webinars. Terms and conditions apply, but check them out! I have 2 Ubiquiti UniFi APs, one in the front of the house, one in the back. They are connected to one of the MS220\u0026rsquo;s, but dont work with its POE (maybe the EdgeRouter could do that, since its POE\u0026hellip;) so there are injectors for them. Anyway, the network ports on there are VLANed to the MX64 (more on that later) and the detault traffic is going to a management VLAN. The MX64 has a static internal IP on my DMZ network, and uses the Proliant as an upstream connection. Upstream on the Hetzner server, all traffic coming from the MX64 ip uses one of my /29 ip block. all traffic to that ip is also forwarded directly to the MX64. I has 2 small, unmanaged switches (a cheap 8 port Linksys and a 8 port TP Link) which are used for seperate things: the Linksys has 4 Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s, which run a [GlusterFS] cluster, plugged into it and the TP Link connects to my printers. I also have a Mikrotik CRS226-24G-2S+IN which has 2 10Gbit SFP+ Ports, and plan on using this for higher speed networking soon, aswell as a Cisco 48 port 3560 which also has 4 SFP ports (GigE) and may come in handy for something soon\u0026hellip;  So, thats the network currently. any questions, please leave a comment.\n","tags":["Networking","HomeLab"],"title":"Meraki and Ubiquiti networks gear Update","type":"post","url":"/2016/06/20/meraki-gear-update.html","weight":0,"wordcount":474},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1465344000,"description":"","dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":400,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531466330,"objectID":"799fae5b8a9e6a09b663f3ada49ca86d","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2016/06/08/double-speed-internet-part-8-routing-around.html","publishdate":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2016/06/08/double-speed-internet-part-8-routing-around.html","section":"post","summary":"[NOTE] This part 8 in a series of posts.

Quagga/Zebra has static routes (currently static, planing on dynamic soon\u0026hellip; more eventually) to different servers depending on where they are. for example, all traffic to the hetzner network (including their Storage Boxes) go though the hetzner link. Hubic traffic goes though OVH, Azure (currently) and AWS traffic, aswell as some CDNs go direct over either WAN1 or WAN2 in the house, and some other stuff (CrashPlan currently) goes though Digital Ocean. Everything that has no static route goes though Hetzner\u0026hellip; Ideally, the static side of things should be removed, and a more dynamic setup done. How that works, i have no idea\u0026hellip; Spotify have 2 posts about their SDN Internet Router (part 1 and part 2) which is an interesting idea\u0026hellip; More digging and research is required.

So far, so good\u0026hellip; But because i was using a Socks Server, I was not fully able to use the /29 ips\u0026hellip; I use something like as follows:\n essentially, for each public IP i have that i want to map to an internal IP, i have a POST and PRE ROUTING rule, plus the required forward rules\u0026hellip; But, if socks are used, then that goes out the Window, since TCP traffic will look like its coming from the socks server\u0026hellip; So, i killed the socks server, removed the IPTables rule, and then realized that while outgoing traffic was being balanced somewhat (2 default rules on the internal box pointing at the OpenVPN IPs from the Hetzner box) incoming was a problem. Hetzner knew how to get to my internal network, but only though one ip\u0026hellip; enter Quagga and Zebra\u0026hellip;\nQuagga is a routing software suite, which can do protocols like OSPF, BGP and RIP, and Zebra is the component that does static routing. using their documentation on static routes, I created a static route to my internal network with 2 next hops, the OVPN IPs from the internal box\u0026hellip; and, after restarting Quagga, all works! happy days! now i can forward ips from outside the network to inside the network correctly, and they look like they are the public ip!\nSo, whats next then? well, I now have a server in Germany (Hetzner) and one in France (OVH), and can spin one up in the UK or the US (Digital Ocean).

The rest can be found here.\nIts been a while, since I posted, and there are some, well, pretty major changes since the last time\u0026hellip; Lets start are the beginning.\nLast time I was using Digital Ocean for my hosting provider. I was using their $20 a month server (2 cores, 2GB RAM, 40GB SSD, 3TB transfer), and it was all good\u0026hellip; But I noticed that every now and again I would need to reboot the box. I also noticed that when transferring large files or using higher bandwidth (400mb/s+) the 100% of both cores were being used. So, I wanted to move to something with more power\u0026hellip;\nI also was limited to IP addresses. Yes, Digital Ocean do offer IPv6, but I could only get 1 IPv4 address\u0026hellip; and I wanted more\u0026hellip;\nSo, I went back to some old friends of mine, Hetzner, and bought a dedicated server with a Quad Core Xeon E3, 32GB RAM, 4*3 TB HDDs, 1Gbit/s network connection with 30TB transfer per month and a KVMoIP plugged in. I also got 2 extra standard IPs and a /29 (8 IPs, 6 usable). I will explain that next. I installed Debian 8.4 on the first disk, and I am planning on using the other 3 for storage of some sort. I then installed the MPTCP kernel, OpenVPN, Squid and a Socks server (same as the Digital Ocean box) and reconfigured the home machine\u0026hellip; All good! Now when browsing the web, everywhere thinks I am in Germany, but so far, so good\u0026hellip; Speed tests are about the same, but I have my theory about ECMP to try this weekend.\nBecause of the extra IPs, I am working on doing full IP forwarding, not just port forwarding. One of my IPs in pointing directly at my Meraki MX64 in house (a post on the Meraki stuff is coming, eventually\u0026hellip;) and another at the Proliant box, and I plan on pointing other IPs at machines in the DMZ or a firewall of some sort. the /29 is routed though the IP pointing at the Proliant, so that makes life easier. The original IP is only used for SSH and OVPN from the house. it should not do much else. All network traffic in house is coming from other of the other IPs.\nAgain, so far, so good.

The rest can be found here.\nThis post is going to be an update and theoretical post. probably very little \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; stuff going on here, mostly updates, and what I am planning on doing later on.\nThis week, I have been OOF sick, so I have not done much work, but I have been surfing the web, watching videos, downloading stuff, etc., so I have an idea of how things are going. First, as mentioned in the previous post I have MPTCP, Squid, Socks Servers, OpenVPN and IPTables doing their magic. 2 OpenVPN tunnels between the house and Digital Ocean. All TCP Traffic (bar port 80) is sent over socks to the box in the cloud using RedSocks. All UDP traffic is sent direct over OpenVPN. Since MPTCP is in the mix, all socks traffic is actually split over the 2 connections. All port 80 traffic, and 443 (if the client is using local Squid as their proxy) is sent round-robin between the 2 upstream IPs to Squid (2 OpenVPN end points).\nThings I have noticed:\n Every now and again, RedSocks crashes\u0026hellip; just full on dies. It’s just a matter of starting again, but it’s a pain\u0026hellip; I have had to restart squid a couple of times\u0026hellip; not too often though there was a power outage in the house a few days back\u0026hellip; so, when everything came back online, it was a bit of a pain bringing all connections back to life. I do have to figure out a better plan  I still have to read more on this ECMP stuff. Hopefully it will do what I am hoping.\nNow for the theoretical stuff. I started thinking, could this work outside the house? Could you build this into something smaller, like a Raspberry Pi, and stick 2 or more USB Modems in, connect it back to a server in the cloud, setup P2P OpenVPN connections and then get more than a single modem speed download? The problems I can see are around MPTCP. I am not sure if it has been ported to ARM to run on a Raspberry Pi. Second, the max you could ever get out of it is 100Mbit/s, given the 10/100mb network port on board\u0026hellip; and you may need extra power for the USB dongles. Also, getting P2P connections may be complicated, given the non-static IPs on the modems, though, in theory, non-P2P OpenVPN could work\u0026hellip; Again, it’s a theory. I had the though and that’s where the title came from\u0026hellip; anyway, throwing it out there\u0026hellip;\n","tags":["Guide","Networking","IPv6","Projects","HowTo","HomeLab","Double_Internet"],"title":"(Mad) Max Speed - The Road Warrior (Internet connection) (double speed internet Part 5)","type":"post","url":"/2016/04/21/2-cable-modems-double-speed-part-5.html","weight":0,"wordcount":429},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1460592000,"description":"","dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":400,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531466330,"objectID":"e8540a780989a443f4f44b513b3ca5b3","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2016/04/14/2-cable-modems-double-speed-part-4.html","publishdate":"2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2016/04/14/2-cable-modems-double-speed-part-4.html","section":"post","summary":"[NOTE] This part 4 in a series of posts. The rest can be found here.\nSo, this week I went in a completely different direction that I have been thinking recently\u0026hellip;\nSo, the basic theory is as follows:\n I am still using MPTCP kernels on both upstream and local machine now have 2 P2P UDP OpenVPN tunnels between house and cloud. Example config is here all TCP traffic (bar port 80) that hits the router in house is redirected to RedSocks RedSocks uses a socks server, Dante, as an upstream server on the cloud box since the socks traffic is over TCP (inside the UDP OpenVPN tunnel) it uses MPTCP having socks running, gives me quite the download speed, turning it off does not, hence the following tweet  Hmmmm... If I have socks on, the Internet is fast 400mb/s+). But without socks, it\u0026#39;s down to 60... Feck...\n\u0026mdash; Tiernan (@tiernano) April 13, 2016   I am also noticing that I am starting to hit the limits of my upstream VM. If downloading or uploading at speed, the processor cores (2 in the case of the box I am currently running) are pegged at pretty much 100% full\u0026hellip; Well, 80ish, but that because the other 20% is being used by Dante. I am noticing I can hit a full 72Mbit/s up, but the max currently downloading is about 400, maybe 450\u0026hellip; Need a faster box now\u0026hellip; I mentioned port 80 not being set over socks. That\u0026rsquo;s because its redirected to Squid. Squid (in house) then uses Squid (in cloud) as a parent.

Well, it came out last week, and I installed it as soon as I could! My next challenge was to get Jekyll to run and install on it, so I can build and preview this site on my Surface Book.\nSo, first, I needed to install version 2.0 of Ruby. There is a bit of messing involved for this, but first\napt-get update apt-get install ruby2.0  Now, when you run\nruby -v  you will still see ruby 1.9.x installed\u0026hellip; and the github-pages gem, which includes Jekyll 3, requires ruby 2.0\u0026hellip; ugh. after reading this very long bug report I got this:\n# Rename original out of the way, so updates / reinstalls don't squash our hack fix dpkg-divert --add --rename --divert /usr/bin/ruby.divert /usr/bin/ruby dpkg-divert --add --rename --divert /usr/bin/gem.divert /usr/bin/gem # Create an alternatives entry pointing ruby -\u0026gt; ruby2.0 update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/ruby ruby /usr/bin/ruby2.0 1 update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gem gem /usr/bin/gem2.0 1  Now, when I run ruby -v, I am told I am on version 2.0! Happy days! Next, i installed bundler using\ngem install bundler  which uses a Gemfile to install the required gems, so running\nbundle install  should install all required gems but no luck\u0026hellip; I tried adding ruby2.0 dev to the mix\napt-get install ruby2.0-dev  but running jekyll from bash said it did not exist, and running\nbundle exec jekyll build  failed with a memory issue\u0026hellip; ugh\u0026hellip;\nAnyway, next, I tried\ngem install github-pages -V  -v makes it verbose, so you can see what\u0026rsquo;s going on\u0026hellip; after a bit of time, and lots of output to the screen\u0026hellip;\njekyll build bash: /usr/bin/jekyll: No such file or directory  FECK!

The rest can be found here.\nIn Part 1 of this series I explained the why and what I wanted to do for this \u0026ldquo;project\u0026rdquo;. In Part 2 I did some basic testing of both MPTCP and MLVPN. I also mentioned trying MMPPP using vtund but it has been a while since I did that testing, and it had not been on bare metal. So, this post is a follow up, where I am using bare metal.\nSo, first, the setup:\n ProLiant box is running Debian 8.3 x64, and has both vtund and ppp installed Digtial Ocean box also has Debian 8.3, vtund and ppp installed walked though the guide from John Lewis and made some changes to the configs. the main ones are mentioned below  Once done, i installed both iperf and iftop on both boxes, and ran\niperf -s  on the Digital Ocean box and\niperf -c 192.168.10.1 -d  on the local box. And, well, the results where not as expected. Pretty poor actually:\nFirst, using Squid installed on the DO box, i tried using WGET to download a file using it. If I did this on the DO box itself, i was getting 100MBytes/s\u0026hellip; When I ran it over the MLPPP box, well, under 7 was achieved.\nThen i though it might have been Squid. So, since the file had been downloaded to DO, i SFTPed into the box over the MLPPP link, and tried again\u0026hellip; Again, pretty poor result. I think i seen it hit about 7MB a sec at one stage.\nHere is what is showing on the DO box when running the SFTP download. You can see 2 connections from the 2 WAN links at home hitting the box, and they are balanced. Its just nowhere near the speed they are capable of.\nI did not get a screen shot of this, but when I tried with iperf, thinking it might have been overhead of SFTP or Squid, I was getting results matching what I was seeing with SFTP. Downloads in the 55-60mbit/s range for download and 40ish for upload. 40 is still faster than 1 link, mind you\u0026hellip;\nI mentioned that I had made some minor tweaks to the configs from what John had written. Well, mostly it was config changes to how routing was done. In Johns case, he is bonding a DSL and a HSDPA connection, so he had setup to do for logging into his PPP modem and connecting. Also, when he setup the interfaces, he routing tables in there. I have mine setup in a single config file, like as follows:\n I have changed the names from adsl1 and 2 to WAN1 and 2, and the IPs are changed from internal IPs to my public IPs. I manually run this when setting up my connection.\nNothing else on his config files have changed. I did not do any of the masquerading stuff, mainly cause this was testing. I just want a tunnel to start with. When reading the vtund.conf file, you can see that encryption and compression are both turned off, and and the same in the ppp configuration. I also don\u0026rsquo;t think the issue is to do with the CPU performance, since these are the screenshots of top running on both boxes:\nin both cases, CPU usage is sub 6% for VTUN and SSH seems to be using less than 10%. So, now, I\u0026rsquo;m baffled as to why this is not performing as expected\u0026hellip; More testing required!\n[update 4/4/2016] - fixing images so they are clickable\u0026hellip;\n","tags":["Guide","Networking","IPv6","Projects","HowTo","HomeLab","Double_Internet"],"title":"2 Cable modems = Double speed?

The rest can be found here.\nIn my previous post I explained what i was trying to do\u0026hellip; This post explains what i have been working on recently, and performance results\u0026hellip; So, first, what have i tried\u0026hellip; There are 3 different things i have tried, and here are some of their details. Some will need to be updated (other parts of this series), and others i will try get back to eventually.\nHardware and servers used To test this, i am using my HP Proliant ML110 G5 running either Ubuntu or Debian Linux, with 2 GigE connections directly to the cable modems, and 1 connection to the LAN (for SSH and testing). The LAN has no gateway set, and the 2 WAN connections have DHCP enabled. They get fully public IP addresses. Upstream, I am using either Digital Ocean or ScaleWay VPS boxes.\nDigital Ocean has the advantage of allowing different Kernels, so i have been using them for testing MPTCP. As for ScaleWay, well, their BareMetal C2S/M/L boxes have between 4 and 8 cores (4 for the S, 8 for the M and L) and between 8 and 32Gb RAM (S=8, M=16, L=32GB). The L model also comes with 256GB SSD (plus the boot disk, which seems to be a network disk of some sort) and they all come with lots of bandwidth (i use the L because its got about 800MBit/s to the internet).\nPing wise, Digital Ocean is about 20-30ms away from the house (I picked London to host the servers) and Scaleway is a little further at about 50ms (They are based in France).\nMPTCP (MultiPath TCP) MPTCP (their site is a bit wonky as of writing, so bare with me\u0026hellip;) is a Linux Kernel patch that allows TCP connections to use multiple paths\u0026hellip; Essentially, if you have Wifi and 4G in a phone, and MPTCP is enabled, it should allow you to use both connections for TCP traffic, as long as the server upstream supports it. It also allows for easy fail over if, say, you lose your wifi connection. There is an example video of it on YouTube which should show the fail over parts and this video shows how they managed to get 50Gbit/s out of a 6 10Gb Ethernet connections.\nWhen i was using MPTCP, I had a copy of Squid on both boxes, and told Squid locally to use Squid on the upstream box (over a SSH tunnel, which was over the MPTCP link) as a parent cache. Using this method, i could see (using iftop) that both connections were being used. When trying proper performace testing, I setup a RAM disk on both machines and copied a Linux ISO to the Digtial Ocean Box. Then, using wget and Axel I downloaded the files using Nginx on the server, and checked the results. I can max out 1 single connection, plus use about 60-80mbit/s from the second. about 420-440mbit/s total. Disk was not the bottleneck, since I was writing to RAM, so more tests are required.\nMLVPN MLVPN is a pretty interesting project that caught my eye. The idea is quite simple: you configure the local box and server, as mentioned in their example guide and run the MLVPN program on the server, then the client. It creates 2 VPN tunnels between the 2 boxes, and bonds them\u0026hellip; In my case, i was given an IP of 10.42.42.1 on my box in house and 10.42.42.2 on the server. Any traffic over that tunnel is bonded\u0026hellip; Problem is, it seems to be quite processor intensive: my Digital Ocean box was showing one cpu core (out of 2) maxing out at around 80% and my Proliant in house maxing around the 70% mark\u0026hellip; all while transferring data at around 100mbit/s. I tried iperf and got the following:\ngetting 50mbit/s upload is good, in reality, since in theory my max speed would be 72, without overhead. but 116mb/s down is less than a third the max speed of a single connection. So, I tried just uploads and downloads\u0026hellip;\nUpload Only (from local machine to server)\nDownload Only (from server to local machine)\nAs you can see, the download speed has increased a little, to 176Mbit/s, but the upload speed is now at over 60MBit/s!\nStill.. download is as important as upload, and given I haven\u0026rsquo;t managed to get it to max out one connection, never mind 2, even more testing is required\u0026hellip;\nMLPPP (using VTUN) This is one i need to come back to\u0026hellip; Used the guide from John Lewis but was only managing to get about 100Mbit/s\u0026hellip; I was originally using a VM (so disk may have been the issue) and also had the connection behind my EdgeRouter, so it might have been firewall rules causing a slow down. But I do need to come back to this soon\u0026hellip; Watch this space.\nConclusions? Well, at the moment, all I can conclude is that there is more testing required. Upload wise, i can somewhat use most of my bandwidth with MLVPN, and I did see promising results with MPTCP. I gave up a bit too early with MLPPP, so more testing is required with that. Also, all tests are using just iperf between boxes. I did use squid with the MPTCP box for a while, but not for proper performance testing. So, even once this is all sorted out, i will need to turn this into a proper \u0026ldquo;router\u0026rdquo; too\u0026hellip; So, conclusion? this was originally meant to be a 2 parter\u0026hellip; now it looks like I will require a lot more parts\u0026hellip; Watch this space\u0026hellip;\n","tags":["Networking","Projects","IPv6","Guide","HowTo","HomeLab","Double_Internet"],"title":"MPTCP, SSH, Squid, OpenVPN (and 2 Cable modems) = Double Speed?

I tried a few different options, including an RB1100 and running their RouterOS on x86 hardware\u0026hellip; Both worked, well, ok, and the Load balancing with nth stuff did do what i needed, along with other stuff, like routing traffic destined for some sites (like BBC iPlayer) to go over a VPN. But in the end, hardware issues and performance problems with the x86 machine (Mikrotik at the time was limited to 2GB of RAM on x86 hardware) I ended up at PfSense.\nPfSense was installed on the same hardware, a HP ProLiant ML110 G5 with 8GB RAM, a Core2Quad processor and 12 GigE Network cards\u0026hellip; And, on PfSense, things were good\u0026hellip; Performance was stable, load balancing worked as expected, I could set some traffic to go over certain links, etc. all was good\u0026hellip; But I lacked IPv6\u0026hellip; Plus, the HP used a LOT of power\u0026hellip;\nThe current instalment of my network uses a Ubiquiti Networks Edge Router POE.

They are the guys who design the BackBlaze storage pods (I want one, by the way!) that allow them to provide unlimited storage for the fiver a month (I currently backup over 4Tb to them!), and late last year, they started offing B2 which is a storage platform on their pods, and it has a (somewhat) easy to use API. AND ITS CHEAP! half a cent, up 0.5c, per gig stored per month! That’s crazy cheap!\nB2Uploader uses the B2 API to upload files (it could do more, but currently, as the name suggests, its upload only). Its quite simple, and all the code is available. More stuff coming over the next few weeks. some of the usual badges for open source applications are below. if you want to shout at me, shout in the Gitter chatroom and I will reply. You can see the latest builds over on travis-ci, and the latest releases are available on GitHub.\n\n\nThe second project is still in the planning phase, and it’s an update to an older project I was working on called HubicTesting.

I have 2 of these in GodBox 2, and you can get them into a microATX board. There does seem to be some limits with the microatx boards, but hopefully enough searching will find me what i am looking for. Ideally, i want it to take \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; DDR3/4 memory (not SODIMMs like the ASRock one above) and also take enough of them to run 64 or 128Gb of ram (thinking 8 would do the job!). Also, i would like to have 4 GigE ports onboard and 1 management port. 4 onboard is not a hard requirement: If i can get one with 2 ports, i can always get a 4 port card for the PCI-Express slot\u0026hellip; Finally, i would like it to have at least 6 SATA ports and possibly an MSATA port.

Using Storage Spaces, use the 2 SSDs as \u0026ldquo;Fast\u0026rdquo; storage for the pool.\nI also think i moved off the idea of 10Gb. I like the idea of it, but given a small 10Gb switch costs upwards of a grand, and the plan is to build a machine for that price, i would prefer a fifth machine and using my existing Cisco 48 port switch and leave 10Gb as a future upgrade.\nAlso, changed from last time round is machine count. Originally i was saying 3-4 machines\u0026hellip; now i am thinking 6-7\u0026hellip; 5-6 of them should be Hyper-V boxes and the last one would be a Media Box.\nI also think the Synology or SAN requirement is out\u0026hellip; Hyper-V can be setup to do replication between hosts, and with a 4Gb link to the LAN, i think i should be OK.

I am in the process of rebuilding my home lab, which involves pull all old servers out of the rack and replacing them with new ones\u0026hellip; It also means rewriting the network, possibly upgrading some existing gear and hopefully getting the whole lot done on a budget of some sort\u0026hellip;\nSo, why? Well, biggest reason for all this is currently heat and power usage. We use about 4-6x more electricity than the average house here in Ireland, which means our electricity bill is fairly high. It also means that the lab, which is also my office/bedroom, gets quite warm and uncomfortable during the summer month. There is an Air-Con unit in the room, and, well, that\u0026rsquo;s costing the most on electricity!\nSo, what I got is a basic overview of what I want from the homelab and hopefully in the next post, I will have an idea of what it will look like..\n 3-4 machines running a Hyper Visor (HyperV, VMWare ESXi or other). Leaning more towards Hyper-V purely because its what I got currently and its what we use in our main office. each machine should be connected to at least 2 networks: one for storage and migration, one for \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; to the LAN. There may be more VLANs for other networks, but 2 is a start. ideally, 10Gb connections would be nice, but multiple 1Gb connections would also work. shared storage (iSCSI, SMB3, etc) would also be a nice to have, but may bump up the server count (not actually a problem) but would increase power and cooling costs. An off the shelf box, like a Synology could do the job\u0026hellip; Lower power usage and less heat produced is also a major requirement. Most of the boxes I am decommissioning are older Xeon hardware (5000 series upto a 5200 series process and even an older Xeon P4!). The newer Xeon E3 and the even newer Xeon D are a lot more efficient, use less power, produce less heat and are way faster than what I currently have. The E3 can use up to 32Gb of RAM and the Xeon D top out at 128Gb\u0026hellip; Me being me would like more than 32Gb RAM\u0026hellip; :) smaller machines would also be nice. I have been looking at both Xeon D and Xeon E3 Mini-ITX boards and cases for them. I do have a half height Dell Rack, which I host these machines, and ideally, these machines should be rack mountable, but micro ATX cases could work. 2 per shelf would work grand. Onboard IPMI and KVM support is something I want too\u0026hellip; I do have a KVMoIP switch in the house, and it works, most of the time, but getting a box that has this embedded into the board would be ideal\u0026hellip; A lot of the server boards had it as standard or allowed it to be speced, so that\u0026rsquo;s all good. I am also thinking of upgrading the router to a similar spec board\u0026hellip; Possibly a Xeon E3, or even an i5\u0026hellip;. Ideally it should have IPMI and KVMoIP on board and should produce less heat. Biggest issues is getting enough network cards into the box\u0026hellip;  These are my requirements at a high level overview.

It has a quad core Xeon, 32Gb ram, 3x3Tb hdds, RAID controller and KVMoIP. one of the first thing i did was get myself a /29 IP pool (8 total, 6 usable IPs). There where already 3 IPs given to me: 1 for the KVM, one for the box itself, and 1 as the router for the IP block.\nSo, i need to setup my own router, so i picked PFSense since its what i run in house. I gave it 2 network connections: 1 connected to the main network adapter on the VMWare ESXi box (public) and one to a virtual switch, which is only used by VMs. The public is the WAN link and it gets a static IP from Hetzner, and the virtual switch is then my \u0026ldquo;LAN\u0026rdquo; link. This allows me to have standard NATed network connections to any VM i have, but then, what do i do with those IPs?\nSo, after a lot of digging, i found the answer. So, this should help.\n Under firewall, click on Virtual IPs. click the plus. I then selected IP alias, selected the WAN interface and set the IP to my first public IP i wanted to give. in my case, i was given a /29 block, and my first address was 176. This is the network address. I used 177. Likewise, my last address is 183, but that cannot be used either as its a broadcast address. give it a description and then hit OK. Repease for all IPs you want to use. TIP: Give each a meaningful description! Next, click firewall, NAT and 1:1. Click the add button and select your interface as WAN. set the External Subnet IP as the one you want to use and your internal IP as the machine that will have it. Thats all i did on that screen\u0026hellip; Then go to Firewall, NAT, outbound\u0026hellip; this is where things got complicated. Set the mode to \u0026ldquo;Manual outbound NAT rule generation (AON - Advanced Outbound NAT)\u0026rdquo; and click save. Then create a new rule: Interface: WAN, Source, Network, IP of the internal machine and then under translation, under address select the IP you want to give it. If you followed my tip in step 2, you should see the descriptions in here.  After saving everything and reloading the firewall, visiting a page like WhatsMyIP or ICanHazIP should show you your public IP. You can then create firewall rules to allow access. Quick idea would be:\nFirewall/Rules, Add, Interface WAN, Destination: Local IP you want to use, and give whatever \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; rules you would (HTTP, lock down to source address, etc). Click apply and hitting that address using what ever method (SSH, HTTP, etc) should work.\nYMMV, but hopefully this helps!

After the webinar, i was contacted by Maraki and given a MR18 with a 3 year license, to play with and evaluate. So, i set it up in the house and all was good.\nThing is, the wifi in the house was grand previously. I have a Routerboard RB951G which does the job and has no issues. And because i am mostly offsite in the office i work, and because i need to remotely manage the network, the MR18 is going into the office from tomorrow morning. I may talk about the MR18 and the rest of the Meraki gear later on, but this is not that post. This post is about something the MR18 did, and i wanted to do on the RB951.\nSo, the MR18 allows you to create multiple Wifi SSIDs, each with different encryption and security and can use different VLANs. Now, the Mikrotik does the same, but the VLANs stuff is not that easy to figure out. but essentially, what i needed to do was as follows:\ncreate your new wifi SSIDs:\n/interface wireless add master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan1.10 ssid=vlan10 add master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan1.20 ssid=vlan20  next, create your vlans. these need to be connected back to your main ethernet connection. In the case of my RB951, there are 5 ethernet ports. 1 is the gateway back to my Cisco switch and on to my PFSense router. 2-5 are all slaves of number 1, which is a master. So, 1 is essentially a trunk network. So, vlans are created on that.\n/interface vlan add name=vlan10 interface=ether1-gateway name=ether1.10 vlan-id=10 add name=vlan20 interface=ether1-gateway name=ether1.20 vlan-id=20  next, a bridge to connect them\n/interface bridge add name=vlan10 add name=vlan20  and connect them to the bridge\n/interface bridge port add bridge=vlan10 interface ether1.10 add bridge=vlan10 interface wlan1.10 add bridge=vlan20 interface ether1.20 add bridge=vlan20 interface wlan1.20  And thats all i needed to do. I have a Sophos UTM Home edition running on a vm for testing, which vlan10 is connected to. It has an upstream connection back to the PFSense box, which has it firewalled off and allows it outside the network, not nothing else.

Well, this is how you get it to work\u0026hellip;\nFirst, i am using Ubuntu 14.04 (i think\u0026hellip;). I use Ubuntu in house for a few things:\n its running Tiernan\u0026rsquo;s Comms Closet, GeekPhotographer and Tiernan\u0026rsquo;s Podcast all in house, aswell as being used to build this site. The Web Server and MySQL Server are seperated, MySQL running on Windows, web on Ubuntu\u0026hellip; but thats a different story\u0026hellip; I have a couple of proxy servers running Ubuntu also Other general servers running Ubuntu\u0026hellip; dont ask, cause i cant remember what they do half the time\u0026hellip;  So, Duplicity is a backup application. From their website:\nWhat is it?\nDuplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup. Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server.\nThe duplicity package also includes the rdiffdir utility. Rdiffdir is an extension of librsync\u0026rsquo;s rdiff to directories\u0026mdash;it can be used to produce signatures and deltas of directories as well as regular files. These signatures and deltas are in GNU tar format.\nSo, how do we get it working? Well, givin that i am on Ubuntu, these are the steps i needed to do:\n first, we need some credentials and API keys\u0026hellip; If you havent signed up for HubiC Do so now\u0026hellip; That url gets you an extra 5Gb if you sign up for free (usually 25Gb) or if you pay 1EUR a month, you get 110Gb (usually 100Gb) and 5EUR a month gets you a staggering 10TB (yup! Terabytes!). Login to Hubic, and in the menu go to \u0026lsquo;My Account\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Developers\u0026rsquo;. in here, create a new application (name and URL to redirect to\u0026hellip; http://localhost seems to work correctly). Get the Client ID and Secret ID that was given to you. take the contents of the following gist and replace your own details\u0026hellip; I know, i am not a fan of sticking my password in a txt file\u0026hellip; but it should be your local machine\u0026hellip; that file should be in your home directory and should be called .hubic_credentials. add the duplicity PPA project (https://launchpad.net/~duplicity-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) to ubuntu using the add-apt-repository command (details on the link above, under the link \u0026lsquo;read about installing\u0026rsquo;). for me, i just called \u0026lsquo;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:duplicity-team/ppa\u0026rsquo; install duplicity by doing \u0026lsquo;sudo apt-get install duplicity\u0026rsquo;. Dont forget (its in the tutorial above!) to do an \u0026lsquo;sudo apt-get update\u0026rsquo; first! When i ran that, there where a few extra Python packages to be installed, so i was asked did i want to install them\u0026hellip; Say, yes. Now, to run a backup we run the following command:  duplicity ~/ cf+hubic://location\n cf+hubic is the backend to use, ~/ is the url to backup (my home directory in this case) and location is where on Hubic we want it stored. If this doesent exist, not a problem\u0026hellip; it will create it. after we run this we\u0026hellip; ahhh\u0026hellip; i get an error:  BackendException: This backend requires the pyrax library available from Rackspace.\n right\u0026hellip; pyrax library is from Rackspace and is available to download though pip\u0026hellip; I seem to have python and a few other bits installed on this machine, so running \u0026lsquo;sudo pip install pyrax\u0026rsquo; works\u0026hellip; Your millage may vary\u0026hellip; [eg, this is out of scope for this tutorial! your on your own!] Other problem\u0026hellip; I got a load of weird and wondering errors like this:  AttributeError: 'Module_six_moves_urllib_parse' object has no attribute 'SplitResult'\n I fixed these by running:  sudo pip install furl --upgrade\n FINALLY! ITS ALIVE!!! by default, it asks you for a key for the GnuPG encryption\u0026hellip; and its all good! the first backup creates the directories, required files, etc. the next time you run the command, it will only upload changes. it will also ask for your GnuPG code you entered, so remember it!

Boot storage and cache storage At least 1, possibly more, WiFi Adapters, with optional antennas At least 1, possibly more, 3G or 4G Modems At least 1 ethernet port, again possibility for more Battery that can run the whole system for at least 4-5 hours, and should be able to run while being charged. charging via USB would be ideal also Optional Screen, but more likley, some sort of web interface to show whats going on (Bandwdith usage, clients connected, connection details)  When this turns on, it should automatically start the 3/4G connections (if there are multiple connections, it should do some balancing of the connections). if there are more then 1 WiFi Connection, one should be a Client (connect to an external WiFi connection, like home, college, work) and one should be an Access Point (Your Phone, Tablet and Laptop connect to this one). Ethernet can also be used in a simular way (if one only, it could be client or server, if multiple, one can be client, one can be server). DHCP addresses will be given out on Access Point or Server connections, and on Client connections, DHCP will be accepted.\nSquid would be installed and listen on its usual port. Optionally, all port 80 and 8080 traffic could be routed though Squid. Ideally, HTTPS traffic should be automatically routed, but i think thats a bit harder to setup\u0026hellip; If VPN Clients are enabled, it could also allow All or Some traffic to be routed over the VPN connections. SSH could also be used to compress traffic between multiple Squid boxes (one in house, one on the device). WANProxy could be used in a simular manner to save bandwdith and make the connection faster.\nSo, with all that, i am looking at using a Raspberry Pi for the job. I am still working on this, but here is what i have so far\u0026hellip;\n I have put a Wifi adapter into my Raspberry Pi (A Linksys, but forget the exact model number). Using a tutorial on Vivek\u0026rsquo;s blog on making a wifi hotspot on linux i managed to get the AP showing up on my laptop, but could not connect. I am not sure if its the adapter causing the problem, or what, but i am going to change out the adapter. At the moment, i am sharing the ethernet connection, not the 3G connection\u0026hellip; I have posted here before the link to Terence Eden\u0026rsquo;s post on getting the Raspberry Pi to connect to 3G. All that i will need to do is connect to 3g and then NAT the connection from Wifi to 3G\u0026hellip;  So, there are a few more bits and pieces to get done over the next while\u0026hellip; I will keep posting here\u0026hellip;\n","tags":["Raspberry_Pi","Networking","Projects"],"title":"Raspberry Pi as a Mobile WiFi HotSpot (part 1)","type":"post","url":"/2013/01/18/raspberry_pi_as_a_mobile_wifi_hotspot_-_part_1.html","weight":0,"wordcount":642},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1358277782,"description":"","dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":400,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531466330,"objectID":"387fbdb9d89face687a9abfa6b156275","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2013/01/15/moving_sites_to_nearlyfreespeech.html","publishdate":"2013-01-15T19:23:02Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2013/01/15/moving_sites_to_nearlyfreespeech.html","section":"post","summary":"I have been running a Dedicated Server from Hetzner for a while now, but have started to look at what i am running on the site, and reailized i under utilize the machine a lot\u0026hellip; For example, this site is generated using Jekyll, which takes up very little power, and becomes static HTML files.

I also, a long time ago, talked about Backing up SQL, MySQL and other stuff on my other blog. Well, CrashPlan is all good, but there are 2 \u0026ldquo;niggly\u0026rdquo; bits with it\u0026hellip;\n Its not FREE (well, this year i got it Free on Black Friday\u0026hellip;) but it is cheap ($120 a year to backup 10 machines to the cloud aint bad.) Its NOT FAST! The CrashPlan Datacenters all live in the US, and my servers live in Europe (either Dublin or Germany). So, bandwidth is limited\u0026hellip; Getting less than 1Mbit/s most times, but have seen it reach 3\u0026hellip; I have 20Mbits/s upload\u0026hellip; even half that would be nice\u0026hellip;  So, thats where Symform comes in. Symform is a P2P Backup Service, which runs on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. In theory, it should run anywhere that has a Mono runtime since its written in .NET. Anyway, you start with 10Gb of free storage, and you can increese that by one of 2 ways:\n Pay money: for $0.15 per month, you get 1Gb of storage in the cloud Pay Bytes: For every 2Gb \u0026ldquo;Contributed\u0026rdquo; (which is actually more like a pledge than a contribution\u0026hellip; more on that later) you get 1Gb storage in the cloud.  It works very well, and is nice a fast too. I have a few machines in house which are contribting stoage, a total of about 2Tb, and I have been given 1Tb storage in \u0026ldquo;The Cloud\u0026rdquo;. There is a lot more on how this works on their \u0026ldquo;How Symform Works\u0026rdquo; section of their site.\nI mentioned the \u0026ldquo;Contribution\u0026rdquo; VS \u0026ldquo;Pledge\u0026rdquo; up above\u0026hellip; I have a machine in the house where i have Pledged 1Tb of storage. In reality, Symform can use the full 1Tb of storage, if it needs to, but is currently only using 168Gb. Now, that could just be that the machine is still getting files, and it will end up using the full 1Tb eventually, but either way, its all good.\nAlso, as a couple of notes on Contribution and Backups:\n The machine needs to be online and accessable on the internet at least 80% of the time, but 24\u0026frasl;7 is ideal. If you drop below the 80%, your account can be suspended. your machine needs to be publically accessable, meaning port forwarded. I have a couple contribution machines in house, so they each have seperate ports forwarded to them. Given the P2P nature of the software, lots of connections to different machines are made\u0026hellip; if you are behind a firewall, you may need to allow all or most outgoing connections. If you are on a really restrictive firewall, you may want to stick a contribution box in your DMZ and probably use the Turbo Seeding feature. Turbo Seeding is a handy feature, especially for Laptops\u0026hellip; only problem is its Windows Only\u0026hellip; So, importing and exporting does not work on Linux or OSX. The software can managed Work and Non Work hours, and will limit the upload and download speed during this time. Also a nice feature\u0026hellip;  So far, so good. Very happy with the software, but would like a nicer interface to see whats going on. At the moment, you are either limited to using the web interface, which aint bad, but not great, or watching the log files\u0026hellip; I would also like the ability to prioritize certain files or folders, so, for example, upload my documents folder before anything else, and if anything changes in there, even if its uploading from somewhere else, pause and upload the documents folder\u0026hellip; Just a thought\u0026hellip;\n","tags":["Backup","Storage","Networking","P2P"],"title":"Symform - P2P Backup","type":"post","url":"/2012/11/30/symform_-_p2p_backup.html","weight":0,"wordcount":599},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1354205809,"description":"","dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531466330,"objectID":"e5628b7f91d1e86856588d2432969dd1","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2012/11/29/enabling_vnc_from_ssh_on_osx.html","publishdate":"2012-11-29T16:16:49Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/2012/11/29/enabling_vnc_from_ssh_on_osx.html","section":"post","summary":"I have a Late 2008 MacBook Pro in the house, and SSH is enabled on it.

They also allow me to make cheap calls to Irish Mobiles (check their rates here) SipGate gave me a incoming UK phone number.

Other times they should go though SipDiscount or BlueFace. if the PSTN is busy, fall over to one of the other providers\u0026hellip; Irish Mobile calls should go though SipDiscount and then fall back to land line, or if i ever get the BlueTooth setup working, SipDiscount, then bluetooth, then landline\u0026hellip; International calls should be sent though SipDiscount or Blueface, whichever is cheaper\u0026hellip;  Its going to be an interesting setup\u0026hellip; :)\n","tags":["VoIP"],"title":"More VoIP Stuff","type":"post","url":"/2012/09/27/more-voip-stuff.html","weight":0,"wordcount":407},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1348531200,"description":"","dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531466346,"objectID":"5e10e80b7caa84bb50e657d8bd630fb9","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2012/09/25/raspberry-pi-cross-compiling.html","publishdate":"2012-09-25T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/2012/09/25/raspberry-pi-cross-compiling.html","section":"post","summary":"My main machine at home, known as \u0026ldquo;The GodBox\u0026rdquo; is a Dual Processor, Quad Core Xeon 5520 with 60Gb RAM, 2 300Gb 10,000 RPM Western Digital Velociraptor in RAID 0 for boot, 4X1Tb 7200RPM drives for storage, 2 more 300Gb 10,000 RPM drives for \u0026ldquo;scratch disk\u0026rdquo; and a couple high(ish) end graphics cards with 3 monitors plugged in\u0026hellip; Hence the name, GodBox!\nAnyway, The Raspberry Pi, on the other hand, has a 700Mhz processor, 256Mb RAM and not much else\u0026hellip; So, if you need to write code for your Pi, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to wait a long time to compile, check out this tutorial on how to build a cross compiler for your raspberry pi which will allow you to build your apps on a different machine\u0026hellip; I have a college project which the Raspberry Pi will be used for, and i am thinking this will be how i build code.\n","tags":["Raspberry_Pi","Programming"],"title":"Building a Cross Compiler for your Raspberry Pi","type":"post","url":"/2012/09/25/raspberry-pi-cross-compiling.html","weight":0,"wordcount":152},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1348444800,"description":"","dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":300,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531466346,"objectID":"2ba7c7f85c3d39a493b3720f8687ffac","permalink":"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2012/09/24/microtik-routeros-vpn-setup.html","publishdate":"2012-09-24T00:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2012/09/24/microtik-routeros-vpn-setup.html","section":"post","summary":" I have been running a MikroTik RouterBoard in the house for a couple of months now (the RB750G) and I am very much loving the thing.

Line 3 sets all traffic comming from networkaddress/24 (for example, 192.168.0.1\u0026frasl;24) to be sent though the VPN. any traffic going into networkaddress (same example) is not sent though the VPN. Line 4 creates a gateway, for all addresses (0.0.0.0/0) to use the VPN address. finally, NAT Masquerading is enabled on the VPN interface.\nthere are more advanced things you can set above\u0026hellip; some examples I can think of are as follows:\n There should be no good reason to limit the amount of VPN connections you have\u0026hellip; in theory, you could have multiple\u0026hellip; for the mangle rule, set the src-address to a single machine in your network. that way, it gets VPN only connections. Also, you could set the dst-address to a single address or network to send only traffic going to a given server though the VPN\u0026hellip; Example would be Netflix US traffic to a US VPN server, BBC iPlayer traffic to a UK VPN, etc. the example above uses L2TP, but PPTP, SSTP and OpenVPN are also available.
