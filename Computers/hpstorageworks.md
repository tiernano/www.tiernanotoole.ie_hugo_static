# HP StorageWorks P4300 G2 servers

I bought 2 [HP StorageWorks P4300 G2][1] servers a while back. They each have Dual Xeon [E5520][2] Quad core processors, 12Gb RAM, 8 1TB SAS Disks (i think they are 7200RPM) and each include 2 GigE net ports and an [IPMI][3] management port. Planning on doing something with these soon...
