This machine has a [Core2Quad Q6600][1], 8Gb RAM and some storage...
It also has 12 Gigabit network ports:

* 2 Quad port Intel Gigabit NICs (PCI Express)
* 1 Dual Port Intel Gigabit NIC (PCI-X in a PCI slot)
* 1 Single Port Intel Gigabit NIC (PCI Express)
* 1 Single onboard NIC (don't know who make it)

This machine was doing lots of testing for the [Double speed Internet][2] series but is currently sitting idle...
