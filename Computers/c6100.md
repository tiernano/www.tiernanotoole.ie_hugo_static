# Dell C6100 servers

I bought a [Dell C6100][2] a while back. 4 nodes, each with Dual [Xeon E5506][1] processors, 36Gb RAM. They share 12 drives bays (3 dedicated to each machine) and each machine has 2 GigE ports and an [IPMI port][3].

These machines are running [Windows Server 2016][5], and have a mix of drives, mostly spare. I think 3 have a 250Gb Drive, one boots from a 750Gb disk, and 2 have 64Gb SSDs for extra space, one has a 500Gb for extra space. They all have Hyper-V enabled, managed by [SCVMM][4] and have both NICs connected to my main switch in teamed mode.

VMs hosted on them include:

* DHCP Server running on Windows Server 2016 Core
* 2 Active Directory boxes, currently running Windows Server 2012 R2, but soon to get upgraded to 2016 Core
* Linux VM running docker (with multiple containers)
* Linux VM for monitoring network
* Linux VM for [Ubiquiti Networks][6] controller
