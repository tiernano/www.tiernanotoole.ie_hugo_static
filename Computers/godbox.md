# GodBox V1

The GodBox is my main Hyper-V server and backup workstation. Its specs are as follows:

* Dual [Intel Xeon E5520][1] processors at 2.26Gz each. They are Quad core and are Hyper Threaded... Windows sees 16 processors!
* 84Gb RAM (DDR3)
* 2 300GB [Western Digital VelociRaptors][2] in RAID 0 for boot.
* 4 hard drives in a storage pool. cant remember the sizes. these are connected to a Dell Perc H200, but no raid is used on the card.
* Connected to a DVI KVM switch and used on a [28 Inch Dell 4K Monitor][3]
* Runs Windows Server 2016 Datacenter, Hyper-V and has a few VMs running all the time...

Some old photos of the machine are seen here:
