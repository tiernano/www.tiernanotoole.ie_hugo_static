      <description>See what i did with the title?! Anyway, in my last post, i explained how i was building this site with Docker running on Windows 10 with the Anniversary update. Today, i am going to show you how to host it using Nginx and ngrok.
So, first, you should know what Nginx is at this stage&amp;hellip; If not, check out their site. Next ngrok is basically a way of tunneling your localhost to the web.</description>

      <description>As some of you probably know (or based on the footer of the site) this site is built with Jekyll. Jekyll is a static web site builder, written in Ruby, and is a bit of a pain to build on Windows. Earlier on this year, I wrote up a post explaining how to use Jekyll on Windows using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows&amp;hellip; It was a bit complicated, and, well, worked a few times, but was not too successfull&amp;hellip; So, were do we go next?</description>
