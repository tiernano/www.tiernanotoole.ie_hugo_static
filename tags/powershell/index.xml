      <description>A few years back, i created a post showing you how to add an Alias to PowerShell to easily start Sublime Text from a PowerShell command line . This worked well, but this is 2017 (that post is from 2012!) and my daily text editor has changed. I have moved to Visual Studio Code for most of my daily work. It works well 95% of the time. I still use Visual Studio Pro for C# Development, but for quick fixes and work on, say Go or smaller edits, Code is great.</description>

      <description>I have an AppleTV in the house (3, actually) and i am very happy with its ease of use, size and cost&amp;hellip; You cant really argue with the small price!
I also have a lot of content that works great with the AppleTV in iTunes, but i have content which does not work so great with the AppleTV&amp;hellip; So, i needed to find a way to convert files quickly and easily&amp;hellip; thats where PowerShell and Handbrake come in&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>My new Favorite cross platform text editor is Sublime Text 2. It works on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, and i am very happy with it. My only problem is the path to start it is not exactly easy to type&amp;hellip; So, with the help of PowerShell, my new favorite command line tool on Windows, i added an alias:
Set-Alias subl &#39;c:\program files\sublime text 2\sublime_text.exe&#39;  I added this to my Microsoft.</description>
