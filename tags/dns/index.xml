      <description>so, earlier on today, i was talking about using Git with a DNS service called LuaDNS to update your DNS records. Well, thing is, i have 30+ domains registered, and of them about 25 are hosted on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Route53. So, moving ALL of them seems, well at the moment, excessive&amp;hellip; So, i went digging&amp;hellip;
there is a tool called cli53 which will allow you to manage route53 objects from the command line.</description>

      <description>There are now a lot of services that have &amp;ldquo;git push&amp;rdquo; options available&amp;hellip; you can build websites with Azure and Github, books using ShareLaTeX and now, DNS using LuaDNS. I have one zone running at the moment (tiernanotoole.net) and you can see the DNS records on github here. I am tempted at moving other records over soon&amp;hellip; but i am currently on Amazon Route53 and 1: its works, so dont break it, and 2, not sure how to bulk export records from Route53 to Bind or Lua format.</description>
