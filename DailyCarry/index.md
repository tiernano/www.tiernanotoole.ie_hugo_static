A couple of years back, I did a post about my [Daily Carry for college][1]... Well, I have finished (ish) college, but i still cary a lot of weird and wonderful stuff... So, this is the update...

So, the contents are as follows:

* Microsoft [SurfaceBook][14] with an i7 processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB Storage, along with the dGPU. 
* [Samsung Galaxy Note 3][3]
* [Beats by Dr. Dre Wireless on ear headphones][4]. Bluetooth and wired
* [TP-Link TL-WR703N][5] modified with extra RAM and ROM. I will explain this later...
* [TP-Link MR3040][6] currently used with the modem (see below) but to be replaced with the WR703N eventually...
* [Huawei E3272 LTE Modem][7] for broadband. Connected into either of the routers (above) or directly to the laptop.
* [Anker 3 Port USB 3.0 HUB with 10/100/1000mb Ethernet][8] Probably the coolest thing i have ever found! a 3 port USB 3 hub with a Gigabit Ethernet port included! There is one that came with the M3800, but its USB2 only (so, not fully gigabit) and takes up a USB port and gives nothing back...
* [Anker 3nd Gen Astro E4 13000mAh 2 Port External Battery][9]. Handy little charger, since most of my devices run off USB. And it gives out a fair whack of power too!
* [Linx 8 Inch Windows 8.1 Tablet][12] with Intel Quad core Atom (Z3735G) 1Gb RAM, 32Gb storage, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a 32Gb MicroSD card. Great little device, and handy when the M3800 is too big to use...
* [Microsoft Wedge Keyboard][10] and [Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000][11] both connected to the Linx Tablet to have a full setup when required.
* [Apple iPhone 6 Plus][13] (Not pictured). This was used to take this photo.
