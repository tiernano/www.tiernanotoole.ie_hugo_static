        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eSo, a few days back I got an email from \u003ca href=\"http://www.packet.net\"\u003ePacket.net\u003c/a\u003e about a promotion they and AMD where running. Essentially, they gave me some credit for their service (i am an existing customer) to play with one of their c2.medium machines. A c2.medium comes with an \u003ca href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7401p\"\u003eAMD EPYC 7401P\u003c/a\u003e which consists of 24 physical cores clocked at 2Gz with an all core boost at 2.8Gb and a max clock of 3Gz, 48 threads, 64GB ECC Memory, 2x120GB SSDs for boot and 2x480GB SSDs for main stoage. It also has a 20Gb network link (2x10gb bonded) and can run pretty much any OS you can think of (Windows is not on the list officially, but you can boot off your own ISO, so you could probably get it on there\u0026hellip; might not be supported, but it might be possible). all this for $1 per hour! And did i mention they are bare metal machines?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the perfect opertunity to play with the new AMD processors. My current and previoius generation workstations (GodBoxv1 and Godboxv2) are both running Intel Xeon processors. the machine previous to this, the mac pro, is also running a Xeon processor. But previous to both of them, my first 2 major workstations ran AMD\u0026hellip; the first ran 2 AMD Athlon MP processors. These were old school processors that were single core, and i cant even remember their speeds, but i do know there were 32bit only and the machine maxed out at about 1.25GB RAM (well, i had it maxed out at that). the second AMD workstation ran 2 AMD Opterons\u0026hellip; again, single core machines, but this time, they ran 64 bit and IIRC maxed out at 8GB ram. This was a limitation of the board, not the processor\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have been thinking about GodboxV.next, and the AMD processors, specicially the \u003ca href=\"https://products.amd.com/en-us/search/cpu/amd-ryzen%E2%84%A2/amd-ryzen%E2%84%A2-threadripper\"\u003eThreadrippers\u003c/a\u003e and Epycs, are contenders for the next machine\u0026hellip; so, this test allows me to check them out before i buy!Why would i say no?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, i spun a box up in New Jersey running Ubuntu 17.10 to play with it, and here are my findings\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, i ran lscpu on the box to see what i was playing with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tiernano/4877abe19c89f1e45e617da1b4d46447.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI then ran fdisk -l to see what disks i had to play with. on my machine sda and sdb where the 480gb SSDs, sdc was a 120gb that was empty and sdd was the boot drive\u0026hellip; i installed the btrfs-progs and then formatted sda and sdb as a RAID0 array, which i then mounted to /mnt. this gave me just under 900gb to play with\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, my first test is the usual test: building the Linux Kernel. I know that this is something that the lads at \u003ca href=\"http://www.servethehome.com\"\u003eServeTheHome\u003c/a\u003e do a lot but its something i wanted to try my self\u0026hellip; So, first i installed git and build essential, then bison, flex and ncurses-dev, then i cloned Linus\u0026rsquo; git repo at git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git. First things first: this machine has a twin 10gb link, a shead load of cores and some very fast storage. How long did it take to clone? it download 1.02 GiB at 35.32MiB/s (about 30 seconds and aboiut 280Mbit/s) and all in, took 2 min 55 seconds to clone. I then ran \u0026lsquo;time make -j 49\u0026rsquo; to see how long it would take\u0026hellip; hmmm\u0026hellip; no config file\u0026hellip; make menuconfig and just hit save\u0026hellip; defaults are grand\u0026hellip; time make -j 49 again\u0026hellip; and more errors\u0026hellip; after a bit of googling, i find the page from Ubutnu \u003ca href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/GitKernelBuild\"\u003eshowing what i need to do to build the kernel\u003c/a\u003e. i follow that\u0026hellip; download a LOT more stuff using their instrustions, and finally, we get to build\u0026hellip; Time: 6 min 12 seconds\u0026hellip; this is a FULL default build of the kernel\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/v1530618253/top_kernel_build_epy_hdb0R.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSame build on a VM on GodboxV2 (which was given 32GB RAM and 16 thread, so a full Xeon E5-4620) took 8min 27s to clone (8.18MiB/s. or about 64Mbit/s) and 36 min\u0026hellip; yea, that is 3x less cores, 2x less memory, slower storage (This is on Spinny Disk, not SSD), slower network and it is also a VM VS bare metal, still, to be essentially 6 times slower? interesting\u0026hellip; I might, at some stage, boot the machine off a live Linux USB and run some more tests, but not tonight\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/v1530618253/top-kernel-build-godboxv2.png\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, all this is becasue i was holding out for the main event\u0026hellip; Photo processing\u0026hellip; I wanted to do somethign \u0026ldquo;real life\u0026rdquo;, which for me would be development and photo processing\u0026hellip; the kernel build gives an idea of a large project build built, the image processsing gives an idea of multimedia work\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eso, i devised a test: Export a bunch of photos (mix of photos taken on my 5Ds, 5D MKII, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 7Plus) that are stored in light room as full  and run them though a basic .NET Core app i wrote. the code for the app is \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/imageresizer-testapp\"\u003eavailable here\u003c/a\u003e. The app fully utilizes the machine by using multiple threads, and because its 64 bit, it will use as much memory as it can get its hands on. It just does some basic processing: open the file, resize to 1024X1024 and then save it\u0026hellip; the 1024X1024 part is just a test\u0026hellip; i was a bit under the gun on time, so couldnt spend as much time working on it as i wanted to\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn total, there was 1546 photos exported, and the total file size was 15Gb. First obstical was to get them uploaded to the Packet machine, which took a while (my upload speed is currently 40Mbit/s)\u0026hellip; Once up, i downloaded a copy of dotnet core 2.0 SDK, cloned the repo with the project, built and ran\u0026hellip; and man, its fast! 4 min 43 seconds. And it used all the cores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/v1530618252/image-resizer-epyc.png\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRunning the same code on GodBoxV2 on the bare metal (no VM this time), i got XX min of a run\u0026hellip; Now, GodBoxV2 has other things running in the back ground, but not that much\u0026hellip; I also noticed that, on average, photos were being processed in 3-5 seconds on Epyc, but nearly 13-15, and sometimes 20 and 25 seconds on GodBoxV2. I also noticed that on Epyc, the dotnet process took nearly 45GB of RAM\u0026hellip; to run\u0026hellip; On GodBoxV2, it took over 70!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/v1530618252/image_resizer_godbox_f5de0.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, there you have it. Some starting tests with these processors. I am well impressed with these processors, and would have no issue getting one for the next GodBox\u0026hellip; And with names like Epyc and Threadripper, why not?!\u003c/p\u003e\n"

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eSo, if you are reading this page, it is being delivered with the magic of Anycast\u0026hellip; Well, technically, it was before, since i used \u003ca href=\"http://cloudflare.com\"\u003eCloudflare\u003c/a\u003e, and it still is because of Cloudflare, but also because of my own ASN (\u003ca href=\"http://as204994.net\"\u003eAs204994\u003c/a\u003e), some servers in different locations, and some magic, which i will explain a bit of in this post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis all started late last year when i got my hands on an ASN and a /48 block of IPv6 addresses. I had been reading stuff about BGP, routing, etc, and decided to go all in. it was quite cheap with the help of \u003ca href=\"https://my.hostus.us/aff.php?aff=2152\"\u003eHostUS\u003c/a\u003e. All in, it was about $50 for the year. As part of the process, i needed 2 upstream providers to say they would accept my announcement. They were \u003ca href=\"https://www.he.net\"\u003eHurricane Electric\u003c/a\u003e though their \u003ca href=\"http://www.tunnelbroker.com\"\u003eTunnel Broker\u003c/a\u003e service, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6925432\"\u003eVultr \u003c/a\u003eusing a few of their VPSs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter i got my space and ASN, i started to announce the V6 addresses over Vultr and Hurricane Electric, and all was good. I had 2 Vultr servers: 1 in London, UK, and one in New Jersey, USA. I had my home machine announce to HE, and then also link to both Vultr servers using \u003ca href=\"https://www.zerotier.com\"\u003eZerotier\u003c/a\u003e. All worked well, but due to some family issues, i never got around to putting it into production\u0026hellip; till now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose 3 servers now share an IPv6 address on the loopback port. When you (well, Cloudflare) asks for that IP, the closet (network) with that IP responds, and the NGinx server on that box sends back the contents of the site. This site is hosted on each box, since its fully static, but both \u003ca href=\"https://as204994.net\"\u003eAS204994 \u003c/a\u003eand \u003ca href=\"https://tiernanotoole.net\"\u003eTiernanOToole.net\u003c/a\u003e are hosted in Ghost, so Dublin (my machine in the house) serves them, and both Lon1 and Nyc1 do proxying. so, most requests from the US are hitting the box in NYC and the ones in Europe share either Dub1 or Lon1. I have some tweaks to do with which servers will be running where, and may add more, but currently its working well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, how do you figure out what server responded? Simple. Open your Dev tools on your browser, go to network tab, refresh, and see the response headers for anything on this domain. You should see something like below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/2018/04/01/responding-server.PNG\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next while, i will be updating tiernanotoole.net with more details on how this works, and more stuff will end up on AS204994.net too. If anyone notices any weird and wonderful issues, shout. If you have more questions, shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eSo, a few months back I bought myself an \u003ca href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro\"\u003eiPad Pro\u003c/a\u003e. I got a 10.5\u0026rdquo; with 64GB Storage and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MPTL2LL/A/smart-keyboard-for-105‑inch-ipad-pro-us-english?fnode=37\"\u003eSmart Keyboard\u003c/a\u003e. Since then, i have been mostly using it for playing around: watching YouTube, Netflix, surfing on the couch, etc. but i started to wonder how \u0026ldquo;Pro\u0026rdquo; this was\u0026hellip;so i went and did some testing, and in the end nearly all of this post is being written on it\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003efirst, the good stuff:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ai/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id714464092?mt=8\"\u003eMicrosoft\u0026rsquo;s Remote Desktop Connection\u003c/a\u003e works perfect on the iPad Pro. I have RDPed into machines (with the help of \u003ca href=\"http://www.zerotier.com\"\u003eZeroTier\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prompt-2/id917437289?mt=8\u0026amp;uo=4\u0026amp;at=11l4BV\"\u003ePanic\u0026rsquo;s Prompt\u003c/a\u003e works well too\u0026hellip; again, with ZeroTier, i can SSH into boxes and remote manage them. Handy for checking on docker instances\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePanic also have \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coda/id500906297?mt=8\u0026amp;at=11l4BV\"\u003eCoda for iOS\u003c/a\u003e. its a very nice (if somewhat expensive at $25) editor for the iPad. This post is being written on there now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor Git stuff, i am using an app called \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8\u0026amp;uo=6\u0026amp;at=1000lHq\u0026amp;ct=workingcopyapp\"\u003eWorking Copy\u003c/a\u003e. Its free, to an extend, but if you need to do stuff like push changes, which is kind of important, then you need to pay a fee.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCoda and Working Copy work together with some magic built into Working Copy. It can act as a \u003ca href=\"https://workingcopyapp.com/manual/webdav-server\"\u003eWebDav server\u003c/a\u003e, which Coda can the connect to. you open, edit, change and create docs, and Working Copy keeps note. then you swap to them and checkin. You need to have both apps on the screen at the same time (the docking feature works well for that) since iOS seems to kill some background tasks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnrelated to blogging, but i have also tried editing photos using \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ai/app/adobe-lightroom-cc-for-ipad/id804177739?mt=8\"\u003eLightroom\u003c/a\u003e, and so far so good. I have used the \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/product/MJYT2ZM/A/lightning-to-sd-card-camera-reader\"\u003eApple SD Card adapter\u003c/a\u003e to download 50MP photos (upwards of 60MB) from my \u003ca href=\"https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/dslr/eos-5ds\"\u003eCanon 5Ds\u003c/a\u003e quick enough, add them to Lightroom, make some changes and send them to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/tiernano\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, Facebook (not Instagram just yet\u0026hellip;) and it works well. I have managed to hook it to my \u003ca href=\"http://www.gnarbox.com\"\u003eGnarbox\u003c/a\u003e too.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBad Stuff?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ekeyboard takes a bit of getting used to. the Stupid \u0026ldquo;Global\u0026rdquo; button to swap keyboards (from\nEnglish to Emoji) is in the place you would expect to find CTRL. and CTRL, Option and Cmd (remember, this is a \u0026ldquo;Mac\u0026rdquo; style keyboard) and all shifted one place\u0026hellip; I would have preferred if they moved that somewhere else, or removed it altogether\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea mouse would be very handy! I have tried pairing a bluetooth mouse to it, and no luck\u0026hellip; it would be handy especially for editing documents and code, since touchscreen is \u0026ldquo;handy\u0026rdquo; some of the time, but not all the time\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, there you have it. Blogging on an iPad. Would i give up my daily driver of my Surface Book and GodBoxV2 and just uses an iPad? Hell No\u0026hellip; for basic stuff, it works well. Basic photo editing, blogging, surfing, etc, yes. But there is a reason my workstation has 16 processor cores and 160GB RAM: I need it. I have multiple copies of Visual Studio running, SQL Server, multiple VMs running different tasks, multiple web browsers, multiple monitors, etc. the iPad can do a good chunk of stuff, but not the major stuff\u0026hellip; not yet. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong: Word, Excel, Power Point, Outlook. all the major office tools work grand. But Visual Studio? SQL Management Studio? just not there yet\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what did i not do on the iPad, and ended up doing on the PC? Well, so far, nothing\u0026hellip; using Coda and Working Copy, i wrote the text, previewed it and checked it into GitHub. Then, Prompt is being used to build it on my docker box, check into the static site and push, which will then publish. unless you see an update below, all went as planned and all was done on an iPad\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n"

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eSo, a few weeks back, \u003ca href=\"http://www.crashplan.com\"\u003eCrashPlan\u003c/a\u003e, one of my chosen backup services, decided to \u003ca href=\"https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/consumer/nextsteps/\"\u003ekill their consumer backup plans\u003c/a\u003e. Which made me have to rethink my backup plan for the house\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote\u003c/strong\u003e: This is how I am backing up files, and may or may not work for you. Some of this is already in \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo; as of today, but others are planned\u0026hellip; Any questions, comments, etc, leave them in the comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, first, as mentioned above, CrashPlan\u0026rsquo;s consumer backup options are now dead. They are giving you the option of either upgrading to their Small Business Plan for free till the end of your current contract + 2 months, or moving to \u003ca href=\"https://www.carbonite.com/\"\u003eCarbonite\u003c/a\u003e. For me, i just moved to their Small Business option, since its free, and meant that most of my backups just migrated over\u0026hellip; i did not, how ever, look too much into Carbonite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust checking their site now, i would have to go for a minimum of the Plus plan, and that only allows me to backup 1 machine\u0026hellip; I have 2 (currently) that get backed up\u0026hellip; and probably more at a later date\u0026hellip; and, given their yearly price for Plus is $75 per year, thats $150 for 2 current machines, and an extra $75 per machine after\u0026hellip; Granted, they are saying its unlimited storage. but the extra fee per machine puts it out of contention\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor CrashPlans Small Business Plan, their plan is $10 per machine per month\u0026hellip; So, my 2 machines would cost $240 per year to backup. They are giving me the next few months for free, and then for the first year, they are offering a discount of 75%, but we will see what happens when renewal comes along\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, where does that leave me? Well, its looking like i will be using a mix of \u003ca href=\"https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01px2w\"\u003eBackBlaze\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.hubic.com\"\u003eHubic\u003c/a\u003e. The current idea is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eGodBoxV2 and the Mac Mini both have \u003ca href=\"http://www.drobo.com\"\u003eDrobos\u003c/a\u003e plugged into them: the GodBoxV2 has a Drobo 5D, and the mini has a Drobo mini. There is also a Drobo FS on the network. I know they are not backup solutions, but its better than having stuff on single drives\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Windows boxes, I am backing up files to the cloud using \u003ca href=\"https://www.duplicati.com/\"\u003eDuplicati\u003c/a\u003e. These are backed up to both Hubic and BackBlaze B2. Photos and importing files are backed up to both, and stuff i want backed up, but not in 2 places, is just backed up on Hubic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor my Mac mini, i use a a mix of Duplicati and \u003ca href=\"https://www.arqbackup.com/\"\u003eArq Backup\u003c/a\u003e. Arq got B2 support recently, so its very handy for that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor some of my Linux Boxes, i use \u003ca href=\"http://duplicity.nongnu.org/\"\u003eDuplicity\u003c/a\u003e. You may need to walk though the steps i have \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2015/04/01/Duplicity_Hubic.html\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e to get it working with Hubic, and it also works with B2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome further notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eHubic are charging about EUR5 a month for 10Tb of storage. If you refer people, that can go up. I have maxed mine out at 12.5Tb.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eHubic is limited to 10mb/s for uploads and downloads. I never got anywhere close to that speed with CrashPlan (I\u0026rsquo;m based in Europe, they are in the US, so speed of light and what have you\u0026hellip; maxed most of the time at 4ish). That being said, even those its \u0026ldquo;limited\u0026rdquo; to 10mb/s, i have seen higher.,.. might be 10 per thread\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eI did, for a while, use the BackBlaze app and service. I just didn\u0026rsquo;t renew because of the move to B2. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to mess with stuff, their App works great.And if you use \u003ca href=\"https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01px2w\"\u003ethis referal link\u003c/a\u003e you get a free month\u0026hellip; Also, its FAST AF! it actually manged to max out my upload connection to their server! wont complain about that!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eB2 is cheap. 0.5c per gig stored\u0026hellip; So, it works out at about $5 per TB per month, minus your usual bandwidth fees\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuplicati and Duplicity both have options to send emails on success or failure, or the like. I recommend having the emails on failure turned on at a minimum\u0026hellip; also, on headless boxes, like my Linux box, i recommend checking the backup every week\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, there we have it.

Well, this week, the ZeroTier guys tweeted about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDistributed S3 data storage using \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Minio\"\u003e@minio\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZeroTier?src=hash\"\u003e#ZeroTier\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/MAXTjo3muh\"\u003ehttps://t.co/MAXTjo3muh\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; ZeroTier, Inc. (@ZeroTier) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ZeroTier/status/859557214997970944\"\u003eMay 2, 2017\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA few people then started asking questions, and looking for a follow up, so here it is\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, a quick recap. I had 4 machines, all running Linux. Three of them were in 1 time zone (GMT+1) and one was in another (GMT). Looking at the \u003ca href=\"https://docs.minio.io/docs/distributed-minio-quickstart-guide\"\u003eDistributed Minio Quickstart Guide\u003c/a\u003e again, there is a mention of times being in sync\u0026hellip; which is probably why this did not work as planned\u0026hellip; and by \u0026ldquo;not work as planed\u0026rdquo;, I mean that Minio would crash, or not be responsive, or not write data in the place it should have\u0026hellip; which was a pain. But looking at the documentation again, they do mention that Windows support is \u0026ldquo;experimental\u0026rdquo; which means, hopefully, some day it will be not so experimental, and might work\u0026hellip; Given that most of my machines in house are Windows boxes, this would be a nice feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, what about ZeroTier? Given they posted it to their twitter? Well, it worked. it did the inter connect stuff well, and, given bandwidth limitations on a home broadband connection, it was still quite fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, the question is, how fast? Well, on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/Computers/surfacebook.html\"\u003eSurface Book\u003c/a\u003e on a WiFi connection in the house, behind a \u003ca href=\"http://www.meraki.com\"\u003eMeraki\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://meraki.cisco.com/products/appliances/mx64\"\u003eMX64\u003c/a\u003e firewall, connecting to \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/Computers/GodBoxV2.html\"\u003ethe GodBoxV2\u003c/a\u003e over FTP though ZeroTier, i get the following result:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2017/05/05/ftpdownload-zerotier.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2017/05/05/ftpdownload-zerotier-rs.png\" alt=\"FTP over ZeroTier\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ethe same download over FTP direct (no ZeroTier) does the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2017/05/05/ftpdownload-direct.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2017/05/05/ftpdownload-direct-rs.png\" alt=\"FTP direct\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, direct over FTP is faster\u0026hellip; in this instance by about 70%, but, over the download, it did get slower (seen it hit 12 at one stage) and because its over WiFi, those are a bit wonky\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI did get one last screen shot:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2017/05/05/networkspeed.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2017/05/05/networkseed-rs.png\" alt=\"network speed\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eas you can see, the Zerotier network adapter is showing 77.3Mbps, but the main network adapter is showing 80.8Mbps. There would be other traffic there, but if we assume there is nothing but ZeroTier traffic being sent, there is about 5% of an overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, to wrap up: Minio and its distributed storage system over ZeroTier needs more testing. Ideally, all hosts need to be in the same time zone, or at least have the same time\u0026hellip; Will try work on that soon. As for ZeroTier? I am extremely happy with them. Its fast, easy to setup, and easy to configure. What more could you ask for? Oh, and free, unless you need a pro account!\u003c/p\u003e\n"

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eSo, after many (MANY) years messing with dual cable modems, struggling to get them working together, to get websites to even allow me in, having to use hacks and kluges to get it to work at all\u0026hellip; I have given up. It has been a struggle getting two modems working properly. Load blanching \u003cem\u003ekind\u003c/em\u003e of works\u0026hellip; but it\u0026rsquo;s messy at best. Some sites kick you out every now and again because your IP changes. Some sites wont let you login at all\u0026hellip; Mind you, some sites work grand and don\u0026rsquo;t ask questions\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the whole idea of multiple modems, to allow you to download things faster, doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for everything\u0026hellip; Anything you download in the browser is single threaded, so its limited to one modem\u0026hellip; you can use use download accelerators, and they do work, but its an extra step, and some sites don\u0026rsquo;t work for that either (MSDN for example).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, i have given up, bit the bullet, and moved to business class broadband from \u003ca href=\"https://www.virginmedia.ie/business/\"\u003eVirgin Media\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s actually cheaper than the two residential lines i had, but it is also slower than the two combined: previously, it was two x 360/36mb/s. Now i am am on a single 400/40mb/s modem. That being said, there are definite advantages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStatic IPs pretty much as standard, and option of either one or five (no unbeaten!) Guess which one i went with? Its \u003cem\u003etechnically\u003c/em\u003e a /29 range, but the first usable IP is given to the modem, which acts as a gateway, so i end up with five usable.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProper business class SLA. Any issues, someone who knows what they are talking about can help\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePhone lines on a separate modem. So, i got phone lines with them, and they give a separate modem for those lines, so as not to interfere with the internet. that modem has no internet connection and is just for calls. They are also working on a VoIP/SIP offering, which is something i am interested in.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGuaranteed speed! They guarantee a minimum speed to the modem at all time. Business customers have a priority on the network, which is nice. And, during testing, so far, i am getting the advertised speed most of the time. I needed to download a Windows 10 ISO yesterday from the MSDN, and it came in at between 45 and 48MBytes/s!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, only had it installed a week, and so far, so good. I have one IP given to my \u003ca href=\"http://www.pfsense.org\"\u003ePFSesne\u003c/a\u003e box, and the rest given to a \u003ca href=\"http://www.vyos.io\"\u003eVyOS\u003c/a\u003e VM. The plan is to use the VyOS box for all network traffic, but first i need to do some testing and learning\u0026hellip; Expect some posts on this soon!\u003c/p\u003e\n"

Given that i have Quagga running on the box, i am now thinking of trying to see if its possible to route traffic depending on distance or something similar\u0026hellip; If i am trying to hit a server in Hetzner\u0026rsquo;s DC, i should go though Germany. If its in Digital Ocean, go though either US or UK servers, same with OVH. Then figure out who has the fastest links to, say, Amazon, Azure, Netflix, BBC, Dropbox, etc, and add either static or dynamic links to the router\u0026hellip; essentially, thats the theory\u0026hellip; lets see how that works\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n"

I was using their $20 a month server (2 cores, 2GB RAM, 40GB SSD, 3TB transfer), and it was all good\u0026hellip; But I noticed that every now and again I would need to reboot the box. I also noticed that when transferring large files or using higher bandwidth (400mb/s+) the 100% of both cores were being used. So, I wanted to move to something with more power\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also was limited to IP addresses. Yes, Digital Ocean do offer IPv6, but I could only get 1 IPv4 address\u0026hellip; and I wanted more\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I went back to some old friends of mine, \u003ca href=\"http://www.hetzner.de/en\"\u003eHetzner\u003c/a\u003e, and bought a dedicated server with a Quad Core Xeon E3, 32GB RAM, 4*3 TB HDDs, 1Gbit/s network connection with 30TB transfer per month and a KVMoIP plugged in. I also got 2 extra standard IPs and a /29 (8 IPs, 6 usable). I will explain that next. I installed Debian 8.4 on the first disk, and I am planning on using the other 3 for storage of some sort. I then installed the \u003ca href=\"http://www.multipath-tcp.org\"\u003eMPTCP kernel\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.openvpn.net\"\u003eOpenVPN\u003c/a\u003e, Squid and a Socks server (same as the Digital Ocean box) and reconfigured the home machine\u0026hellip; All good! Now when browsing the web, everywhere thinks I am in Germany, but so far, so good\u0026hellip; Speed tests are about the same, but I have my theory about \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-cost_multi-path_routing\"\u003eECMP\u003c/a\u003e to try this weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the extra IPs, I am working on doing full IP forwarding, not just port forwarding. One of my IPs in pointing directly at my \u003ca href=\"https://meraki.cisco.com/products/appliances/mx64\"\u003eMeraki MX64\u003c/a\u003e in house (a post on the Meraki stuff is coming, eventually\u0026hellip;) and another at the \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/Computers/proliantml110.html\"\u003eProliant box\u003c/a\u003e, and I plan on pointing other IPs at machines in the DMZ or a firewall of some sort. the /29 is routed though the IP pointing at the Proliant, so that makes life easier. The original IP is only used for SSH and OVPN from the house. it should not do much else. All network traffic in house is coming from other of the other IPs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, so far, so good. Hopefully the ECMP stuff works correctly, so I will do an updated post soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

First, as mentioned in \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2016/04/14/2-cable-modems-double-speed-part-4.html\"\u003ethe previous post\u003c/a\u003e I have MPTCP, Squid, Socks Servers, OpenVPN and IPTables doing their magic. 2 \u003ca href=\"http://www.openvpn.net\"\u003eOpenVPN\u003c/a\u003e tunnels between the house and \u003ca href=\"https://m.do.co/c/d4d345b83b55\"\u003eDigital Ocean\u003c/a\u003e. All TCP Traffic (bar port 80) is sent over socks to the box in the cloud using RedSocks. All UDP traffic is sent direct over OpenVPN. Since MPTCP is in the mix, all socks traffic is actually split over the 2 connections. All port 80 traffic, and 443 (if the client is using local Squid as their proxy) is sent round-robin between the 2 upstream IPs to Squid (2 OpenVPN end points).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThings I have noticed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEvery now and again, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/darkk/redsocks\"\u003eRedSocks\u003c/a\u003e crashes\u0026hellip; just full on dies. It’s just a matter of starting again, but it’s a pain\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have had to restart squid a couple of times\u0026hellip; not too often though\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere was a power outage in the house a few days back\u0026hellip; so, when everything came back online, it was a bit of a pain bringing all connections back to life. I do have to figure out a better plan\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI still have to read more on this ECMP stuff. Hopefully it will do what I am hoping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow for the theoretical stuff. I started thinking, could this work outside the house? Could you build this into something smaller, like a Raspberry Pi, and stick 2 or more USB Modems in, connect it back to a server in the cloud, setup P2P OpenVPN connections and then get more than a single modem speed download? The problems I can see are around MPTCP. I am not sure if it has been ported to ARM to run on a Raspberry Pi. Second, the max you could ever get out of it is 100Mbit/s, given the 10/100mb network port on board\u0026hellip; and you may need extra power for the USB dongles. Also, getting P2P connections may be complicated, given the non-static IPs on the modems, though, in theory, non-P2P OpenVPN could work\u0026hellip; Again, it’s a theory. I had the though and that’s where the title came from\u0026hellip; anyway, throwing it out there\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n"

So, this post is a follow up, where I am using bare metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, first, the setup:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProLiant box is running Debian 8.3 x64, and has both vtund and ppp installed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://m.do.co/c/d4d345b83b55\"\u003eDigtial Ocean\u003c/a\u003e box also has Debian 8.3, vtund and ppp installed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewalked though the guide from \u003ca href=\"https://johnlewis.ie/bonding-teaming-internet-connections/\"\u003eJohn Lewis\u003c/a\u003e and made some changes to the configs. the main ones are mentioned below\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce done, i installed both iperf and iftop on both boxes, and ran\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eiperf -s\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eon the Digital Ocean box and\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eiperf -c 192.168.10.1 -d\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eon the local box. And, well, the results where not as expected. Pretty poor actually:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, using Squid installed on the DO box, i tried using WGET to download a file using it. If I did this on the DO box itself, i was getting 100MBytes/s\u0026hellip; When I ran it over the MLPPP box, well, under 7 was achieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2016/04/02/20160402-downloading-over-mlppp-orig.PNG\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2016/04/02/20160402-downloading-over-mlppp.PNG\" alt=\"WGET over Squid over MLPPP\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen i though it might have been Squid. So, since the file had been downloaded to DO, i SFTPed into the box over the MLPPP link, and tried again\u0026hellip; Again, pretty poor result. I think i seen it hit about 7MB a sec at one stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2016/04/02/20160402-sftp2-over-mlppp-orig.PNG\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2016/04/02/20160402-sftp2-over-mlppp.PNG\" alt=\"SFTP over MLPPP\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere is what is showing on the DO box when running the SFTP download. You can see 2 connections from the 2 WAN links at home hitting the box, and they are balanced. Its just nowhere near the speed they are capable of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2016/04/02/20160402-sftp-over-mlppp-orig.PNG\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2016/04/02/20160402-sftp-over-mlppp.PNG\" alt=\"iftop running on server\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI did not get a screen shot of this, but when I tried with iperf, thinking it might have been overhead of SFTP or Squid, I was getting results matching what I was seeing with SFTP. Downloads in the 55-60mbit/s range for download and 40ish for upload. 40 is still faster than 1 link, mind you\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned that I had made some minor tweaks to the configs from what John had written. Well, mostly it was config changes to how routing was done. In Johns case, he is bonding a DSL and a HSDPA connection, so he had setup to do for logging into his PPP modem and connecting. Also, when he setup the interfaces, he routing tables in there. I have mine setup in a single config file, like as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tiernano/a9a642c4d029c0dcf8beb926b3588991.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have changed the names from adsl1 and 2 to WAN1 and 2, and the IPs are changed from internal IPs to my public IPs. I manually run this when setting up my connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNothing else on his config files have changed. I did not do any of the masquerading stuff, mainly cause this was testing. I just want a tunnel to start with. When reading the vtund.conf file, you can see that encryption and compression are both turned off, and and the same in the ppp configuration. I also don\u0026rsquo;t think the issue is to do with the CPU performance, since these are the screenshots of top running on both boxes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2016/04/02/20160402-top-view-server-orig.PNG\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2016/04/02/20160402-top-view-server.PNG\" alt=\"Top on Server\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2016/04/02/20160402-top-view-client-orig.PNG\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/post_images/2016/04/02/20160402-top-view-client.PNG\" alt=\"Top on Client\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ein both cases, CPU usage is sub 6% for VTUN and SSH seems to be using less than 10%. So, now, I\u0026rsquo;m baffled as to why this is not performing as expected\u0026hellip; More testing required!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e[update 4/4/2016] - fixing images so they are clickable\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n"

Some will need to be updated (other parts of this series), and others i will try get back to eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"hardware-and-servers-used\"\u003eHardware and servers used\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo test this, i am using my \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/Computers/proliantml110.html\"\u003eHP Proliant ML110 G5\u003c/a\u003e running either Ubuntu or Debian Linux, with 2 GigE connections directly to the cable modems, and 1 connection to the LAN (for SSH and testing). The LAN has no gateway set, and the 2 WAN connections have DHCP enabled. They get fully public IP addresses. Upstream, I am using either \u003ca href=\"https://m.do.co/c/d4d345b83b55\"\u003eDigital Ocean\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://www.scaleway.com\"\u003eScaleWay\u003c/a\u003e VPS boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDigital Ocean has the advantage of allowing different Kernels, so i have been using them for testing MPTCP. As for ScaleWay, well, their BareMetal C2S/M/L boxes have between 4 and 8 cores (4 for the S, 8 for the M and L) and between 8 and 32Gb RAM (S=8, M=16, L=32GB). The L model also comes with 256GB SSD (plus the boot disk, which seems to be a network disk of some sort) and they all come with lots of bandwidth (i use the L because its got about 800MBit/s to the internet).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePing wise, Digital Ocean is about 20-30ms away from the house (I picked London to host the servers) and Scaleway is a little further at about 50ms (They are based in France).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"mptcp-multipath-tcp-http-www-multipath-tcp-org\"\u003eMPTCP (\u003ca href=\"http://www.multipath-tcp.org\"\u003eMultiPath TCP\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMPTCP (their site is a bit wonky as of writing, so bare with me\u0026hellip;) is a Linux Kernel patch that allows TCP connections to use multiple paths\u0026hellip; Essentially, if you have Wifi and 4G in a phone, and MPTCP is enabled, it should allow you to use both connections for TCP traffic, as long as the server upstream supports it. It also allows for easy fail over if, say, you lose your wifi connection. There is an example \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/VWN0ctPi5cw\"\u003evideo of it on YouTube\u003c/a\u003e which should show the fail over parts and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMdPI9Cfi9k\"\u003ethis video\u003c/a\u003e shows how they managed to get 50Gbit/s out of a 6 10Gb Ethernet connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen i was using MPTCP, I had a copy of \u003ca href=\"http://www.squid-cache.org\"\u003eSquid\u003c/a\u003e on both boxes, and told Squid locally to use Squid on the upstream box (over a SSH tunnel, which was over the MPTCP link) as a parent cache. Using this method, i could see (using \u003ca href=\"http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/iftop/\"\u003eiftop\u003c/a\u003e) that both connections were being used. When trying proper performace testing, I setup a RAM disk on both machines and copied a Linux ISO to the Digtial Ocean Box. Then, using wget and \u003ca href=\"http://axel.alioth.debian.org/\"\u003eAxel\u003c/a\u003e I downloaded the files using \u003ca href=\"https://www.nginx.com/\"\u003eNginx\u003c/a\u003e on the server, and checked the results. I can max out 1 single connection, plus use about 60-80mbit/s from the second. about 420-440mbit/s total. Disk was not the bottleneck, since I was writing to RAM, so more tests are required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"mlvpn\"\u003eMLVPN\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://zehome.github.io/MLVPN\"\u003eMLVPN\u003c/a\u003e is a pretty interesting project that caught my eye.

It creates 2 VPN tunnels between the 2 boxes, and bonds them\u0026hellip; In my case, i was given an IP of 10.42.42.1 on my box in house and 10.42.42.2 on the server. Any traffic over that tunnel is bonded\u0026hellip; Problem is, it seems to be quite processor intensive: my Digital Ocean box was showing one cpu core (out of 2) maxing out at around 80% and my Proliant in house maxing around the 70% mark\u0026hellip; all while transferring data at around 100mbit/s. I tried iperf and got the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"20160330-mlvpn-speed-test.PNG\" alt=\"mlvpn speed test\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003egetting 50mbit/s upload is good, in reality, since in theory my max speed would be 72, without overhead. but 116mb/s down is less than a third the max speed of a single connection. So, I tried just uploads and downloads\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUpload Only (from local machine to server)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"20160330-mlvpn-speed-test-upload-only.PNG\" alt=\"mlvpn upload only test\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDownload Only (from server to local machine)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"20160330-mlvpn-speed-test-download-only.PNG\" alt=\"mlvpn download only test\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, the download speed has increased a little, to 176Mbit/s, but the upload speed is now at over 60MBit/s!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill.. download is as important as upload, and given I haven\u0026rsquo;t managed to get it to max out one connection, never mind 2, even more testing is required\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"mlppp-using-vtun\"\u003eMLPPP (using VTUN)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one i need to come back to\u0026hellip; Used the guide from \u003ca href=\"https://johnlewis.ie/bonding-teaming-internet-connections/\"\u003eJohn Lewis\u003c/a\u003e but was only managing to get about 100Mbit/s\u0026hellip; I was originally using a VM (so disk may have been the issue) and also had the connection behind my EdgeRouter, so it might have been firewall rules causing a slow down. But I do need to come back to this soon\u0026hellip; Watch this space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusions\"\u003eConclusions?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell, at the moment, all I can conclude is that there is more testing required. Upload wise, i can somewhat use most of my bandwidth with MLVPN, and I did see promising results with MPTCP. I gave up a bit too early with MLPPP, so more testing is required with that. Also, all tests are using just iperf between boxes. I did use squid with the MPTCP box for a while, but not for proper performance testing. So, even once this is all sorted out, i will need to turn this into a proper \u0026ldquo;router\u0026rdquo; too\u0026hellip; So, conclusion? this was originally meant to be a 2 parter\u0026hellip; now it looks like I will require a lot more parts\u0026hellip; Watch this space\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n"

I tried a few different options, including an \u003ca href=\"http://routerboard.com/RB1100\"\u003eRB1100\u003c/a\u003e and running their \u003ca href=\"http://www.mikrotik.com/software\"\u003eRouterOS\u003c/a\u003e on x86 hardware\u0026hellip; Both worked, well, ok, and the \u003ca href=\"http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Load_Balancing#Nth\"\u003eLoad balancing with nth\u003c/a\u003e stuff did do what i needed, along with other stuff, like routing traffic destined for some sites (like BBC iPlayer) to go over a VPN.

First has been running for a while (first check-in was December 28th) and it’s called \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/b2uploader\"\u003eB2Uploader\u003c/a\u003e. Its a fairly simple Windows application to upload files to \u003ca href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html\"\u003eBackBlaze B2\u003c/a\u003e. If you are not familiar with \u003ca href=\"https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01px2w\"\u003eBackBlaze\u003c/a\u003e, they provide unlimited backup storage for the low price of a fiver a month. They are the guys who design the \u003ca href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-storage-hardware/\"\u003eBackBlaze storage pods\u003c/a\u003e (I want one, by the way!) that allow them to provide unlimited storage for the fiver a month (I currently backup over 4Tb to them!), and late last year, they started offing \u003ca href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html\"\u003eB2\u003c/a\u003e which is a storage platform on their pods, and it has a (somewhat) easy to use API. AND ITS CHEAP! half a cent, up 0.5c, per gig stored per month! That’s crazy cheap!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/b2uploader\"\u003eB2Uploader\u003c/a\u003e uses the B2 API to upload files (it could do more, but currently, as the name suggests, its upload only). Its quite simple, and all the code is available. More stuff coming over the next few weeks. some of the usual badges for open source applications are below. if you want to shout at me, shout in the \u003ca href=\"https://Gitter.im/tiernano/b2uploader\"\u003eGitter chatroom\u003c/a\u003e and I will reply.

The name is very cleverly called, wait for it\u0026hellip; \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/HubicTesting2.0\"\u003eHubicTesting 2.0\u003c/a\u003e!

Cheap (about a tenner a month) for lots of storage (10TB!) but an odd API.. It uses \u003ca href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/\"\u003eSwift\u003c/a\u003e for storage, but has a weird(ish) API for authentication. Anyway, more details will be on the site once I write it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, anyone needing to upload files to B2, check out \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/b2uploader\"\u003eB2Uploader\u003c/a\u003e. Want to work with stuff on Hubic, check out \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tiernano/HubicTesting2.0\"\u003eHubicTesting 2.0\u003c/a\u003e.

I have 2 of these in GodBox 2, and you can get them into a \u003ca href=\"http://www.servethehome.com/asrock-rack-epc612d4i-review-mitx-xeon-e5-platform/\"\u003emicroATX board\u003c/a\u003e. There does seem to be some limits with the microatx boards, but hopefully enough searching will find me what i am looking for. Ideally, i want it to take \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; DDR3/4 memory (not SODIMMs like the ASRock one above) and also take enough of them to run 64 or 128Gb of ram (thinking 8 would do the job!). Also, i would like to have 4 GigE ports onboard and 1 management port. 4 onboard is not a hard requirement: If i can get one with 2 ports, i can always get a 4 port card for the PCI-Express slot\u0026hellip; Finally, i would like it to have at least 6 SATA ports and possibly an MSATA port. Thinking Boot off MSATA (\u003ca href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2016\"\u003eWindows Server 2016 Nano Server\u003c/a\u003e would be used), 2 SSDs and 4 HDDs. Using Storage Spaces, use the 2 SSDs as \u0026ldquo;Fast\u0026rdquo; storage for the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also think i moved off the idea of 10Gb. I like the idea of it, but given a small 10Gb switch costs upwards of a grand, and the plan is to build a machine for that price, i would prefer a fifth machine and using my existing Cisco 48 port switch and leave 10Gb as a future upgrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, changed from last time round is machine count. Originally i was saying 3-4 machines\u0026hellip; now i am thinking 6-7\u0026hellip; 5-6 of them should be Hyper-V boxes and the last one would be a Media Box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also think the Synology or SAN requirement is out\u0026hellip; Hyper-V can be setup to do replication between hosts, and with a 4Gb link to the LAN, i think i should be OK. Also, if i have the media box separate, i should be ok there too. I will detail the media center in a later post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, any suggestions or thoughts on what should and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be looked at?\u003c/p\u003e\n"

Well, biggest reason for all this is currently heat and power usage. We use about 4-6x more electricity than the average house here in Ireland, which means our electricity bill is fairly high. It also means that the lab, which is also my office/bedroom, gets quite warm and uncomfortable during the summer month. There is an Air-Con unit in the room, and, well, that\u0026rsquo;s costing the most on electricity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what I got is a basic overview of what I want from the homelab and hopefully in the next post, I will have an idea of what it will look like..\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e3-4 machines running a Hyper Visor (HyperV, VMWare ESXi or other).

There may be more VLANs for other networks, but 2 is a start.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eideally, 10Gb connections would be nice, but multiple 1Gb connections would also work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eshared storage (iSCSI, SMB3, etc) would also be a nice to have, but may bump up the server count (not actually a problem) but would increase power and cooling costs.

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eSo, a few weeks back, i got my hands on a \u003ca href=\"http://www.hetzner.de/en\"\u003eHetzner\u003c/a\u003e Dedicated box. It has a quad core Xeon, 32Gb ram, 3x3Tb hdds, RAID controller and KVMoIP. one of the first thing i did was get myself a /29 IP pool (8 total, 6 usable IPs). There where already 3 IPs given to me: 1 for the KVM, one for the box itself, and 1 as the router for the IP block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, i need to setup my own router, so i picked \u003ca href=\"http://www.pfsense.org\"\u003ePFSense\u003c/a\u003e since its what i run in house. I gave it 2 network connections: 1 connected to the main network adapter on the VMWare ESXi box (public) and one to a virtual switch, which is only used by VMs. The public is the WAN link and it gets a static IP from Hetzner, and the virtual switch is then my \u0026ldquo;LAN\u0026rdquo; link. This allows me to have standard NATed network connections to any VM i have, but then, what do i do with those IPs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, after a lot of digging, i found the answer. So, this should help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnder firewall, click on Virtual IPs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eclick the plus. I then selected IP alias, selected the WAN interface and set the IP to my first public IP i wanted to give. in my case, i was given a /29 block, and my first address was 176. This is the network address. I used 177. Likewise, my last address is 183, but that cannot be used either as its a broadcast address. give it a description and then hit OK. Repease for all IPs you want to use. TIP: Give each a meaningful description!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNext, click firewall, NAT and 1:1. Click the add button and select your interface as WAN. set the External Subnet IP as the one you want to use and your internal IP as the machine that will have it. Thats all i did on that screen\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThen go to Firewall, NAT, outbound\u0026hellip; this is where things got complicated. Set the mode to \u0026ldquo;Manual outbound NAT rule generation (AON - Advanced Outbound NAT)\u0026rdquo; and click save.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThen create a new rule: Interface: WAN, Source, Network, IP of the internal machine and then under translation, under address select the IP you want to give it. If you followed my tip in step 2, you should see the descriptions in here.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter saving everything and reloading the firewall, visiting a page like \u003ca href=\"http://www.whatsmyip.org\"\u003eWhatsMyIP\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://icanhazip.com\"\u003eICanHazIP\u003c/a\u003e should show you your public IP. You can then create firewall rules to allow access. Quick idea would be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirewall/Rules, Add, Interface WAN, Destination: Local IP you want to use, and give whatever \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; rules you would (HTTP, lock down to source address, etc). Click apply and hitting that address using what ever method (SSH, HTTP, etc) should work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYMMV, but hopefully this helps! Any questions, leave a comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

I\nhave just got my hands on a box on the \u003ca href=\"http://www.hetzner.de/en\"\u003eHetzner\u003c/a\u003e network (more on\nthat later) and using their LARA system i installed ESXi on it.

I though this was a hardware issue, or a config issue, and left it\u0026hellip; yesterday, i had the console open most of the day, and when looking at something i noticed this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/tiernanotoole/image/upload/v1530620877/20150520-esxi-login-errors.png\" alt=\"ESXi Errors\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that\u0026rsquo;s why I couldn\u0026rsquo;t login! So, tip: create a second user account, name it something other than root, give it a secure password and use that to login to your ESXi box. Ideally, your ESXi box should be behind a firewall, but in the case of a dedicated server, that may not be financially feasible\u0026hellip; Hope this helps someone!\u003c/p\u003e\n"

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eAbout a month ago, while i was recovering from surgery, i attended a Webinar on\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.meraki.com\"\u003eCisco Meraki\u003c/a\u003e devices. After the webinar, i was contacted by Maraki and given a \u003ca href=\"https://meraki.cisco.com/products/wireless/mr18\"\u003eMR18\u003c/a\u003e with a 3 year license, to play with and evaluate. So, i set it up in the house and all was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThing is, the wifi in the house was grand previously. I have a \u003ca href=\"http://routerboard.com/RB951G-2HnD\"\u003eRouterboard RB951G\u003c/a\u003e which does the job and has no issues. And because i am mostly offsite in the office i work, and because i need to remotely manage the network, the MR18 is going into the office from tomorrow morning. I may talk about the MR18 and the rest of the Meraki gear later on, but this is not that post. This post is about something the MR18 did, and i wanted to do on the RB951.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, the MR18 allows you to create multiple Wifi SSIDs, each with different encryption and security and can use different VLANs. Now, the Mikrotik does the same, but the VLANs stuff is not that easy to figure out. but essentially, what i needed to do was as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ecreate your new wifi SSIDs:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e/interface wireless\nadd master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan1.10 ssid=vlan10\nadd master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan1.20 ssid=vlan20\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003enext, create your vlans. these need to be connected back to your main\nethernet connection. In the case of my RB951, there are 5 ethernet\nports. 1 is the gateway back to my Cisco switch and on to my \u003ca href=\"http://www.pfsense.org\"\u003ePFSense\u003c/a\u003e router. 2-5 are all slaves of number 1, which is a master. So, 1 is essentially a trunk network. So, vlans are created on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e/interface vlan\nadd name=vlan10 interface=ether1-gateway name=ether1.10 vlan-id=10\nadd name=vlan20 interface=ether1-gateway name=ether1.20 vlan-id=20\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003enext, a bridge to connect them\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e/interface bridge\nadd name=vlan10\nadd name=vlan20\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eand connect them to the bridge\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e/interface bridge port\nadd bridge=vlan10 interface ether1.10\nadd bridge=vlan10 interface wlan1.10\nadd bridge=vlan20 interface ether1.20\nadd bridge=vlan20 interface wlan1.20\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thats all i needed to do. I have a \u003ca href=\"https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/sophos-utm-home-edition.aspx\"\u003eSophos UTM Home edition\u003c/a\u003e running on a vm for testing, which vlan10 is connected to. It has an upstream connection back to the PFSense box, which has it firewalled off and allows it outside the network, not nothing else. I am planning on doing this with other firewalls, just to do some testing with. This allows me to connect my phone or laptop, or any other wifi device, to a given wifi connection and then be on my way. I also have an older Dell PowerConnect switch, which, if i ever get around to it, will have multiple connections back to the Cisco and then allow physical devices to connect to different vlans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny questions, comments, etc, leave a comment blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eI mentioned \u003ca href=\"https://hubic.com/home/new/?referral=GMSQVQ\"\u003eHubiC\u003c/a\u003e in my \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2015/03/31/HubiC_SWIFT_CURL.html\"\u003elast post\u003c/a\u003e, and in it i said that you could use \u003ca href=\"http://duplicity.nongnu.org/\"\u003eDuplicity\u003c/a\u003e for backups. Well, this is how you get it to work\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, i am using Ubuntu 14.04 (i think\u0026hellip;). I use \u003ca href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com\"\u003eUbuntu\u003c/a\u003e in house for a few things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eits running \u003ca href=\"http://blog.lotas-smartman.net\"\u003eTiernan\u0026rsquo;s Comms Closet\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.geekphotographer.com\"\u003eGeekPhotographer\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://podcast.tiernanotoole.ie\"\u003eTiernan\u0026rsquo;s Podcast\u003c/a\u003e all in house, aswell as being used to \u003ca href=\"http://tiernanotoole.ie/2012/08/29/NewSite.html\"\u003ebuild this site\u003c/a\u003e. The Web Server and MySQL Server are seperated, MySQL running on Windows, web on Ubuntu\u0026hellip; but thats a different story\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have a couple of proxy servers running Ubuntu also\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOther general servers running Ubuntu\u0026hellip; dont ask, cause i cant remember what they do half the time\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, \u003ca href=\"http://duplicity.nongnu.org/\"\u003eDuplicity\u003c/a\u003e is a backup application. From their website:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup. Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe duplicity package also includes the rdiffdir utility. Rdiffdir is an extension of librsync\u0026rsquo;s rdiff to directories\u0026mdash;it can be used to produce signatures and deltas of directories as well as regular files. These signatures and deltas are in GNU tar format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, how do we get it working? Well, givin that i am on Ubuntu, these are the steps i needed to do:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efirst, we need some credentials and API keys\u0026hellip; If you havent signed up for \u003ca href=\"https://hubic.com/home/new/?referral=GMSQVQ\"\u003eHubiC\u003c/a\u003e Do so now\u0026hellip; That url gets you an extra 5Gb if you sign up for free (usually 25Gb) or if you pay 1EUR a month, you get 110Gb (usually 100Gb) and 5EUR a month gets you a staggering 10TB (yup! Terabytes!).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLogin to Hubic, and in the menu go to \u0026lsquo;My Account\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Developers\u0026rsquo;. in here, create a new application (name and URL to redirect to\u0026hellip; \u003ca href=\"http://localhost\"\u003ehttp://localhost\u003c/a\u003e seems to work correctly). Get the Client ID and Secret ID that was given to you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etake the contents of \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/tiernano/86ab2e08ba4e588a343a\"\u003ethe following gist\u003c/a\u003e and replace your own details\u0026hellip; I know, i am not a fan of sticking my password in a txt file\u0026hellip; but it should be your local machine\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethat file should be in your home directory and should be called .hubic_credentials.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eadd the duplicity PPA project (\u003ca href=\"https://launchpad.net/~duplicity-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\"\u003ehttps://launchpad.net/~duplicity-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\u003c/a\u003e) to ubuntu using the add-apt-repository command (details on the link above, under the link \u0026lsquo;read about installing\u0026rsquo;). for me, i just called \u0026lsquo;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:duplicity-team/ppa\u0026rsquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003einstall duplicity by doing \u0026lsquo;sudo apt-get install duplicity\u0026rsquo;. Dont forget (its in the tutorial above!) to do an \u0026lsquo;sudo apt-get update\u0026rsquo; first!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen i ran that, there where a few extra Python packages to be installed, so i was asked did i want to install them\u0026hellip; Say, yes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNow, to run a backup we run the following command:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003eduplicity ~/ cf+hubic://location\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecf+hubic is the backend to use, ~/ is the url to backup (my home directory in this case) and location is where on Hubic we want it stored. If this doesent exist, not a problem\u0026hellip; it will create it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eafter we run this we\u0026hellip; ahhh\u0026hellip; i get an error:\n\u003cpre\u003eBackendException: This backend requires the pyrax library available from Rackspace.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eright\u0026hellip; \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax\"\u003epyrax library\u003c/a\u003e is from Rackspace and is available to download though pip\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI seem to have python and a few other bits installed on this machine, so running \u0026lsquo;sudo pip install pyrax\u0026rsquo; works\u0026hellip; Your millage may vary\u0026hellip; [eg, this is out of scope for this tutorial! your on your own!]\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOther problem\u0026hellip; I got a load of weird and wondering errors like this:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003eAttributeError: 'Module_six_moves_urllib_parse' object has no attribute 'SplitResult'\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI fixed these by running:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e sudo pip install furl --upgrade\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFINALLY!

It does not have a \u0026ldquo;phone\u0026rdquo; SIM in it, with calls and texts enabled, instead it has a 3G Data SIM from a dongle\u0026hellip; It works OK, but there are a few issues i have with it\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo easy way to see how much data is being used, unless you Jail Break, and then battery life goes away\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enot very hackable\u0026hellip; other than Jail Break, and thats not hackable enough\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enot a lot of storage: 16Gb, and most of that is takin up by Music and Apps\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eno background network daemons\u0026hellip; more on that in a second\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Network Daemons i am thinking would be useful for a WiFi Hotspot would be \u003ca href=\"http://www.squid-cache.org\"\u003eSquid\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://wanproxy.org/\"\u003eWANProxy\u003c/a\u003e, SSH, PPTP or OpenVPN Client and possibly a downloader of some sort. What i am thinking is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHave a device, that is small enough to fit in a bag, possibly small enough to fit in a jacket pocket. It will probably not be as small as the iPhone.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt should have storage on board. Boot storage and cache storage\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt least 1, possibly more, WiFi Adapters, with optional antennas\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt least 1, possibly more, 3G or 4G Modems\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt least 1 ethernet port, again possibility for more\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBattery that can run the whole system for at least 4-5 hours, and should be able to run while being charged. charging via USB would be ideal also\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOptional Screen, but more likley, some sort of web interface to show whats going on (Bandwdith usage, clients connected, connection details)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen this turns on, it should automatically start the 3/4G connections (if there are multiple connections, it should do some balancing of the connections). if there are more then 1 WiFi Connection, one should be a Client (connect to an external WiFi connection, like home, college, work) and one should be an Access Point (Your Phone, Tablet and Laptop connect to this one). Ethernet can also be used in a simular way (if one only, it could be client or server, if multiple, one can be client, one can be server). DHCP addresses will be given out on Access Point or Server connections, and on Client connections, DHCP will be accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSquid would be installed and listen on its usual port. Optionally, all port 80 and 8080 traffic could be routed though Squid. Ideally, HTTPS traffic should be automatically routed, but i think thats a bit harder to setup\u0026hellip; If VPN Clients are enabled, it could also allow All or Some traffic to be routed over the VPN connections. SSH could also be used to compress traffic between multiple Squid boxes (one in house, one on the device). WANProxy could be used in a simular manner to save bandwdith and make the connection faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, with all that, i am looking at using a \u003ca href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\"\u003eRaspberry Pi\u003c/a\u003e for the job. I am still working on this, but here is what i have so far\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have put a Wifi adapter into my Raspberry Pi (A Linksys, but forget the exact model number).

I am not sure if its the adapter causing the problem, or what, but i am going to change out the adapter.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt the moment, i am sharing the ethernet connection, not the 3G connection\u0026hellip; I have posted here before the \u003ca href=\"http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/07/3g-internet-on-raspberry-pi-success/\"\u003elink to Terence Eden\u0026rsquo;s post on getting the Raspberry Pi to connect to 3G\u003c/a\u003e.

I also, a long time ago, talked about \u003ca href=\"http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/new-backup-plan-out-with-jungle-disk-and-zmanda-cloud-backup-in-with-crashplan-mysqlbf-and-sqlbf/\"\u003eBacking up SQL, MySQL and other stuff\u003c/a\u003e on my other blog. Well, CrashPlan is all good, but there are 2 \u0026ldquo;niggly\u0026rdquo; bits with it\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIts not FREE (well, this year i got it Free on Black Friday\u0026hellip;) but it is cheap ($120 a year to backup 10 machines to the cloud aint bad.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIts NOT FAST! The CrashPlan Datacenters all live in the US, and my servers live in Europe (either Dublin or Germany). So, bandwidth is limited\u0026hellip; Getting less than 1Mbit/s most times, but have seen it reach 3\u0026hellip; I have 20Mbits/s upload\u0026hellip; even half that would be nice\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, thats where \u003ca href=\"https://control.symform.com/Organization/Referral?referralId=96E53D9DC4501633F2294EF202734DB08C00F044\"\u003eSymform\u003c/a\u003e comes in. Symform is a P2P Backup Service, which runs on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. In theory, it should run anywhere that has a \u003ca href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page\"\u003eMono\u003c/a\u003e runtime since its written in .NET. Anyway, you start with 10Gb of free storage, and you can increese that by one of 2 ways:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay money: for $0.15 per month, you get 1Gb of storage in the cloud\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay Bytes: For every 2Gb \u0026ldquo;Contributed\u0026rdquo; (which is actually more like a pledge than a contribution\u0026hellip; more on that later) you get 1Gb storage in the cloud.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt works very well, and is nice a fast too. I have a few machines in house which are contribting stoage, a total of about 2Tb, and I have been given 1Tb storage in \u0026ldquo;The Cloud\u0026rdquo;. There is a lot more on how this works on their \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"http://www.symform.com/join-the-revolution/how-symform-works/\"\u003eHow Symform Works\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo; section of their site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned the \u0026ldquo;Contribution\u0026rdquo; VS \u0026ldquo;Pledge\u0026rdquo; up above\u0026hellip; I have a machine in the house where i have Pledged 1Tb of storage. In reality, Symform can use the full 1Tb of storage, if it needs to, but is currently only using 168Gb. Now, that could just be that the machine is still getting files, and it will end up using the full 1Tb eventually, but either way, its all good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, as a couple of notes on Contribution and Backups:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe machine needs to be online and accessable on the internet at least 80% of the time, but \u003csup\u003e24\u003c/sup\u003e\u0026frasl;\u003csub\u003e7\u003c/sub\u003e is ideal. If you drop below the 80%, your account can be suspended.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyour machine needs to be publically accessable, meaning port forwarded. I have a couple contribution machines in house, so they each have seperate ports forwarded to them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGiven the P2P nature of the software, lots of connections to different machines are made\u0026hellip; if you are behind a firewall, you may need to allow all or most outgoing connections. If you are on a really restrictive firewall, you may want to stick a contribution box in your \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)\"\u003eDMZ\u003c/a\u003e and probably use the \u003ca href=\"http://www.symform.com/our-solutions/key-features/turbo-seeding/\"\u003eTurbo Seeding\u003c/a\u003e feature.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTurbo Seeding is a handy feature, especially for Laptops\u0026hellip; only problem is its Windows Only\u0026hellip; So, importing and exporting does not work on Linux or OSX.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe software can managed Work and Non Work hours, and will limit the upload and download speed during this time. Also a nice feature\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, so good. Very happy with the software, but would like a nicer interface to see whats going on. At the moment, you are either limited to using the web interface, which aint bad, but not great, or watching the log files\u0026hellip; I would also like the ability to prioritize certain files or folders, so, for example, upload my documents folder before anything else, and if anything changes in there, even if its uploading from somewhere else, pause and upload the documents folder\u0026hellip; Just a thought\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n"

They also allow me to make cheap calls to Irish Mobiles (check their \u003ca href=\"http://www.sipdiscount.com/rates\"\u003erates here\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSipGate gave me a incoming UK phone number.

Any incoming PSTN calls will also do the same. Outgoing calls will depend on the dialing plan, which i still need to figure out, but the theory goes as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIrish landline calls at certin times should go though the PSTN (since we get some free calls with our line).

But one thing you may need to do is setup VPN connections\u0026hellip; Here are some tips on how to create a VPN Server and Client on your RouterBoard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"client-setup\"\u003eClient Setup\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eto setup a client, you need to do the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e{% gist 8581643 %}\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does that all do? the first line creates an l2tp-client interface, pointing at \u0026ldquo;servername\u0026rdquo; with the username and password set. encryption, etc is enabled\u0026hellip; Line 2 then enables the client. Line 3 sets all traffic comming from networkaddress/24 (for example, 192.168.0.\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e\u0026frasl;\u003csub\u003e24\u003c/sub\u003e) to be sent though the VPN. any traffic going into networkaddress (same example) is not sent though the VPN. Line 4 creates a gateway, for all addresses (0.0.0.0/0) to use the VPN address. finally, NAT Masquerading is enabled on the VPN interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ethere are more advanced things you can set above\u0026hellip; some examples I can think of are as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere should be no good reason to limit the amount of VPN connections you have\u0026hellip; in theory, you could have multiple\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor the mangle rule, set the src-address to a single machine in your network. that way, it gets VPN only connections. Also, you could set the dst-address to a single address or network to send only traffic going to a given server though the VPN\u0026hellip; Example would be Netflix US traffic to a US VPN server, BBC iPlayer traffic to a UK VPN, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe example above uses L2TP, but PPTP, SSTP and OpenVPN are also available.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"server-setup\"\u003eServer Setup\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned above, L2TP, PPTP, SSTP and OpenVPN servers are available on RouterOs.
