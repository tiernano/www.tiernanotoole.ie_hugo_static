      <p>In <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2016/05/17/double-speed-internet-part-6-hetzner-edition.html">part 6</a> of my <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/tag/Double_Internet/">Double Internet Series</a> I mentioned i was running a <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/">Meraki</a> <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/products/appliances/mx64">MX64</a> in the network, and said i would write up about it. I am taking this oppertunity to also write up about the <a href="http://www.ubnt.com">Ubiquiti networks</a> gear in the house also.</p>

<ul>
<li>First on the list is my older <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-poe/">Ubiquiti Edgerouter POE</a>. It currently in the process of being decommissioned, or used for something else. It was the main edge router for the network: it had both internet connections connected, and did routing, firewalls, etc, but with the <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/Computers/proliantml110.html">Proliant</a> taking over as a router, it is not requried as much any more&hellip; Its still on, mainly because its still a DHCP server, but not much else.</li>
<li>There are 2 <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/products/switches/ms220-8">Meraki MS220-8</a> switches next. <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/Computers/godbox.html">GodBox1</a> and <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/Computers/GodBoxV2.html">Godbox2</a> both connect in here, and are bonded, as is everything else on the network. The MS220-8 has 8 GigE ports, but also has 2 SFP ports. I bought 4 SFP Ethernet adapters and have a short calbe running between the switches. That uplink is also bonded. All going well so far!</li>
<li>All meraki hardware can be managed though the meraki dashboard. check out their site for more details and examples of how to use it.</li>
<li>I bought one of the MS220&rsquo;s from ebay a few months back, and loved it. Then i realized that you can get your hands on free gear, the MX64, an MS220 and a Wifi Access point if you attend their <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/webinars">webinars</a>. Terms and conditions apply, but check them out!</li>
<li>I have 2 <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap/">Ubiquiti UniFi APs</a>, one in the front of the house, one in the back. They are connected to one of the MS220&rsquo;s, but dont work with its POE (maybe the EdgeRouter could do that, since its POE&hellip;) so there are injectors for them. Anyway, the network ports on there are VLANed to the MX64 (more on that later) and the detault traffic is going to a management VLAN.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/products/appliances/mx64">MX64</a> has a static internal IP on my DMZ network, and uses the Proliant as an upstream connection. Upstream on the <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en">Hetzner</a> server, all traffic coming from the MX64 ip uses one of my /29 ip block. all traffic to that ip is also forwarded directly to the MX64.</li>
<li>I has 2 small, unmanaged switches (a cheap 8 port Linksys and a 8 port TP Link) which are used for seperate things: the Linksys has 4 Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s, which run a [GlusterFS] cluster, plugged into it and the TP Link connects to my printers.</li>
<li>I also have a <a href="http://routerboard.com/CRS226-24G-2SplusIN">Mikrotik CRS226-24G-2S+IN</a> which has 2 10Gbit SFP+ Ports, and plan on using this for higher speed networking soon, aswell as a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/catalyst-3560-series-switches/index.html">Cisco 48 port 3560</a> which also has 4 SFP ports (GigE) and may come in handy for something soon&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>So, thats the network currently. any questions, please leave a comment.</p>
