Connected into either of the routers (above) or directly to the laptop. Anker 3 Port USB 3.0 HUB with 10/100/1000mb Ethernet Probably the coolest thing i have ever found! a 3 port USB 3 hub with a Gigabit Ethernet port included! There is one that came with the M3800, but its USB2 only (so, not fully gigabit) and takes up a USB port and gives nothing back&amp;hellip; Anker 3nd Gen Astro E4 13000mAh 2 Port External Battery. Handy little charger, since most of my devices run off USB. And it gives out a fair whack of power too! Linx 8 Inch Windows 8.1 Tablet with Intel Quad core Atom (Z3735G) 1Gb RAM, 32Gb storage, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a 32Gb MicroSD card. Great little device, and handy when the M3800 is too big to use&amp;hellip; Microsoft Wedge Keyboard and Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 both connected to the Linx Tablet to have a full setup when required.

It also has a 20Gb network link (2x10gb bonded) and can run pretty much any OS you can think of (Windows is not on the list officially, but you can boot off your own ISO, so you could probably get it on there&amp;hellip; might not be supported, but it might be possible). all this for $1 per hour! And did i mention they are bare metal machines?This was the perfect opertunity to play with the new AMD processors. My current and previoius generation workstations (GodBoxv1 and Godboxv2) are both running Intel Xeon processors. the machine previous to this, the mac pro, is also running a Xeon processor. But previous to both of them, my first 2 major workstations ran AMD&amp;hellip; the first ran 2 AMD Athlon MP processors. These were old school processors that were single core, and i cant even remember their speeds, but i do know there were 32bit only and the machine maxed out at about 1.25GB RAM (well, i had it maxed out at that). the second AMD workstation ran 2 AMD Opterons&amp;hellip; again, single core machines, but this time, they ran 64 bit and IIRC maxed out at 8GB ram. This was a limitation of the board, not the processor&amp;hellip;I have been thinking about GodboxV.next, and the AMD processors, specicially the Threadrippers and Epycs, are contenders for the next machine&amp;hellip; so, this test allows me to check them out before i buy!Why would i say no?!So, i spun a box up in New Jersey running Ubuntu 17.10 to play with it, and here are my findings&amp;hellip;First, i ran lscpu on the box to see what i was playing with: I then ran fdisk -l to see what disks i had to play with. on my machine sda and sdb where the 480gb SSDs, sdc was a 120gb that was empty and sdd was the boot drive&amp;hellip; i installed the btrfs-progs and then formatted sda and sdb as a RAID0 array, which i then mounted to /mnt. this gave me just under 900gb to play with&amp;hellip;So, my first test is the usual test: building the Linux Kernel. I know that this is something that the lads at ServeTheHome do a lot but its something i wanted to try my self&amp;hellip; So, first i installed git and build essential, then bison, flex and ncurses-dev, then i cloned Linus&amp;rsquo; git repo at git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git. First things first: this machine has a twin 10gb link, a shead load of cores and some very fast storage. How long did it take to clone? it download 1.02 GiB at 35.32MiB/s (about 30 seconds and aboiut 280Mbit/s) and all in, took 2 min 55 seconds to clone. I then ran &amp;lsquo;time make -j 49&amp;rsquo; to see how long it would take&amp;hellip; hmmm&amp;hellip; no config file&amp;hellip; make menuconfig and just hit save&amp;hellip; defaults are grand&amp;hellip; time make -j 49 again&amp;hellip; and more errors&amp;hellip; after a bit of googling, i find the page from Ubutnu showing what i need to do to build the kernel. i follow that&amp;hellip; download a LOT more stuff using their instrustions, and finally, we get to build&amp;hellip; Time: 6 min 12 seconds&amp;hellip; this is a FULL default build of the kernel&amp;hellip;Same build on a VM on GodboxV2 (which was given 32GB RAM and 16 thread, so a full Xeon E5-4620) took 8min 27s to clone (8.18MiB/s. or about 64Mbit/s) and 36 min&amp;hellip; yea, that is 3x less cores, 2x less memory, slower storage (This is on Spinny Disk, not SSD), slower network and it is also a VM VS bare metal, still, to be essentially 6 times slower? interesting&amp;hellip; I might, at some stage, boot the machine off a live Linux USB and run some more tests, but not tonight&amp;hellip;So, all this is becasue i was holding out for the main event&amp;hellip; Photo processing&amp;hellip; I wanted to do somethign &amp;ldquo;real life&amp;rdquo;, which for me would be development and photo processing&amp;hellip; the kernel build gives an idea of a large project build built, the image processsing gives an idea of multimedia work&amp;hellip;so, i devised a test: Export a bunch of photos (mix of photos taken on my 5Ds, 5D MKII, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 7Plus) that are stored in light room as full and run them though a basic .NET Core app i wrote. the code for the app is available here. The app fully utilizes the machine by using multiple threads, and because its 64 bit, it will use as much memory as it can get its hands on. It just does some basic processing: open the file, resize to 1024X1024 and then save it&amp;hellip; the 1024X1024 part is just a test&amp;hellip; i was a bit under the gun on time, so couldnt spend as much time working on it as i wanted to&amp;hellip;In total, there was 1546 photos exported, and the total file size was 15Gb. First obstical was to get them uploaded to the Packet machine, which took a while (my upload speed is currently 40Mbit/s)&amp;hellip; Once up, i downloaded a copy of dotnet core 2.0 SDK, cloned the repo with the project, built and ran&amp;hellip; and man, its fast! 4 min 43 seconds. And it used all the cores.Running the same code on GodBoxV2 on the bare metal (no VM this time), i got XX min of a run&amp;hellip; Now, GodBoxV2 has other things running in the back ground, but not that much&amp;hellip; I also noticed that, on average, photos were being processed in 3-5 seconds on Epyc, but nearly 13-15, and sometimes 20 and 25 seconds on GodBoxV2. I also noticed that on Epyc, the dotnet process took nearly 45GB of RAM&amp;hellip; to run&amp;hellip; On GodBoxV2, it took over 70!So, there you have it. Some starting tests with these processors. I am well impressed with these processors, and would have no issue getting one for the next GodBox&amp;hellip; And with names like Epyc and Threadripper, why not?!",

  "body": "So, if you are reading this page, it is being delivered with the magic of Anycast&amp;hellip; Well, technically, it was before, since i used Cloudflare, and it still is because of Cloudflare, but also because of my own ASN (As204994), some servers in different locations, and some magic, which i will explain a bit of in this post.This all started late last year when i got my hands on an ASN and a /48 block of IPv6 addresses. I had been reading stuff about BGP, routing, etc, and decided to go all in. it was quite cheap with the help of HostUS. All in, it was about $50 for the year. As part of the process, i needed 2 upstream providers to say they would accept my announcement. They were Hurricane Electric though their Tunnel Broker service, and Vultr using a few of their VPSs.After i got my space and ASN, i started to announce the V6 addresses over Vultr and Hurricane Electric, and all was good. I had 2 Vultr servers: 1 in London, UK, and one in New Jersey, USA. I had my home machine announce to HE, and then also link to both Vultr servers using Zerotier. All worked well, but due to some family issues, i never got around to putting it into production&amp;hellip; till now.Those 3 servers now share an IPv6 address on the loopback port. When you (well, Cloudflare) asks for that IP, the closet (network) with that IP responds, and the NGinx server on that box sends back the contents of the site. This site is hosted on each box, since its fully static, but both AS204994 and TiernanOToole.net are hosted in Ghost, so Dublin (my machine in the house) serves them, and both Lon1 and Nyc1 do proxying. so, most requests from the US are hitting the box in NYC and the ones in Europe share either Dub1 or Lon1. I have some tweaks to do with which servers will be running where, and may add more, but currently its working well.So, how do you figure out what server responded? Simple. Open your Dev tools on your browser, go to network tab, refresh, and see the response headers for anything on this domain. You should see something like below.Over the next while, i will be updating tiernanotoole.net with more details on how this works, and more stuff will end up on AS204994.net too. If anyone notices any weird and wonderful issues, shout. If you have more questions, shout.",

I have RDPed into machines (with the help of ZeroTier) Panic&amp;rsquo;s Prompt works well too&amp;hellip; again, with ZeroTier, i can SSH into boxes and remote manage them. Handy for checking on docker instances&amp;hellip; Panic also have Coda for iOS. its a very nice (if somewhat expensive at $25) editor for the iPad. This post is being written on there now. for Git stuff, i am using an app called Working Copy. Its free, to an extend, but if you need to do stuff like push changes, which is kind of important, then you need to pay a fee. Coda and Working Copy work together with some magic built into Working Copy. It can act as a WebDav server, which Coda can the connect to. you open, edit, change and create docs, and Working Copy keeps note. then you swap to them and checkin. You need to have both apps on the screen at the same time (the docking feature works well for that) since iOS seems to kill some background tasks. Unrelated to blogging, but i have also tried editing photos using Lightroom, and so far so good. I have used the Apple SD Card adapter to download 50MP photos (upwards of 60MB) from my Canon 5Ds quick enough, add them to Lightroom, make some changes and send them to Twitter, Facebook (not Instagram just yet&amp;hellip;) and it works well. I have managed to hook it to my Gnarbox too.  Bad Stuff? keyboard takes a bit of getting used to. the Stupid &amp;ldquo;Global&amp;rdquo; button to swap keyboards (from English to Emoji) is in the place you would expect to find CTRL. and CTRL, Option and Cmd (remember, this is a &amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; style keyboard) and all shifted one place&amp;hellip; I would have preferred if they moved that somewhere else, or removed it altogether&amp;hellip; a mouse would be very handy! I have tried pairing a bluetooth mouse to it, and no luck&amp;hellip; it would be handy especially for editing documents and code, since touchscreen is &amp;ldquo;handy&amp;rdquo; some of the time, but not all the time&amp;hellip;  So, there you have it. Blogging on an iPad. Would i give up my daily driver of my Surface Book and GodBoxV2 and just uses an iPad? Hell No&amp;hellip; for basic stuff, it works well. Basic photo editing, blogging, surfing, etc, yes. But there is a reason my workstation has 16 processor cores and 160GB RAM: I need it. I have multiple copies of Visual Studio running, SQL Server, multiple VMs running different tasks, multiple web browsers, multiple monitors, etc. the iPad can do a good chunk of stuff, but not the major stuff&amp;hellip; not yet. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: Word, Excel, Power Point, Outlook. all the major office tools work grand. But Visual Studio? SQL Management Studio? just not there yet&amp;hellip;So, what did i not do on the iPad, and ended up doing on the PC? Well, so far, nothing&amp;hellip; using Coda and Working Copy, i wrote the text, previewed it and checked it into GitHub. Then, Prompt is being used to build it on my docker box, check into the static site and push, which will then publish. unless you see an update below, all went as planned and all was done on an iPad&amp;hellip;",

Some of this is already in &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; as of today, but others are planned&amp;hellip; Any questions, comments, etc, leave them in the comments.So, first, as mentioned above, CrashPlan&amp;rsquo;s consumer backup options are now dead. They are giving you the option of either upgrading to their Small Business Plan for free till the end of your current contract + 2 months, or moving to Carbonite. For me, i just moved to their Small Business option, since its free, and meant that most of my backups just migrated over&amp;hellip; i did not, how ever, look too much into Carbonite.Just checking their site now, i would have to go for a minimum of the Plus plan, and that only allows me to backup 1 machine&amp;hellip; I have 2 (currently) that get backed up&amp;hellip; and probably more at a later date&amp;hellip; and, given their yearly price for Plus is $75 per year, thats $150 for 2 current machines, and an extra $75 per machine after&amp;hellip; Granted, they are saying its unlimited storage. but the extra fee per machine puts it out of contention&amp;hellip;For CrashPlans Small Business Plan, their plan is $10 per machine per month&amp;hellip; So, my 2 machines would cost $240 per year to backup. They are giving me the next few months for free, and then for the first year, they are offering a discount of 75%, but we will see what happens when renewal comes along&amp;hellip;So, where does that leave me? Well, its looking like i will be using a mix of BackBlaze and Hubic. The current idea is as follows: GodBoxV2 and the Mac Mini both have Drobos plugged into them: the GodBoxV2 has a Drobo 5D, and the mini has a Drobo mini. There is also a Drobo FS on the network. I know they are not backup solutions, but its better than having stuff on single drives&amp;hellip; For Windows boxes, I am backing up files to the cloud using Duplicati. These are backed up to both Hubic and BackBlaze B2. Photos and importing files are backed up to both, and stuff i want backed up, but not in 2 places, is just backed up on Hubic. For my Mac mini, i use a a mix of Duplicati and Arq Backup. Arq got B2 support recently, so its very handy for that. For some of my Linux Boxes, i use Duplicity. You may need to walk though the steps i have here to get it working with Hubic, and it also works with B2.  Some further notes: Hubic are charging about EUR5 a month for 10Tb of storage. If you refer people, that can go up. I have maxed mine out at 12.5Tb. Hubic is limited to 10mb/s for uploads and downloads. I never got anywhere close to that speed with CrashPlan (I&amp;rsquo;m based in Europe, they are in the US, so speed of light and what have you&amp;hellip; maxed most of the time at 4ish). That being said, even those its &amp;ldquo;limited&amp;rdquo; to 10mb/s, i have seen higher.,.. might be 10 per thread&amp;hellip; I did, for a while, use the BackBlaze app and service. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t renew because of the move to B2. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to mess with stuff, their App works great.And if you use this referal link you get a free month&amp;hellip; Also, its FAST AF! it actually manged to max out my upload connection to their server! wont complain about that! B2 is cheap. 0.5c per gig stored&amp;hellip; So, it works out at about $5 per TB per month, minus your usual bandwidth fees&amp;hellip; Duplicati and Duplicity both have options to send emails on success or failure, or the like. I recommend having the emails on failure turned on at a minimum&amp;hellip; also, on headless boxes, like my Linux box, i recommend checking the backup every week&amp;hellip;  So, there we have it.

If you dont have one, just create the file, add that piece of text, and next time you open PowerShell, you are good to go.In my case, i am actually in the Visual Studio Code Insiders group, so my alias is:Set-Alias code &amp;quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\\Code - Insiders.exe&amp;quot;  When these are set (and you have restarted your PowerShell windows), you can now run the following commands:code filename.txt code folder mm filename.txt  VSCode will open either files or folders, but it seems Markdown Monster only opens files.",

(@ZeroTier) May 2, 2017  A few people then started asking questions, and looking for a follow up, so here it is&amp;hellip;First, a quick recap. I had 4 machines, all running Linux. Three of them were in 1 time zone (GMT+1) and one was in another (GMT). Looking at the Distributed Minio Quickstart Guide again, there is a mention of times being in sync&amp;hellip; which is probably why this did not work as planned&amp;hellip; and by &amp;ldquo;not work as planed&amp;rdquo;, I mean that Minio would crash, or not be responsive, or not write data in the place it should have&amp;hellip; which was a pain. But looking at the documentation again, they do mention that Windows support is &amp;ldquo;experimental&amp;rdquo; which means, hopefully, some day it will be not so experimental, and might work&amp;hellip; Given that most of my machines in house are Windows boxes, this would be a nice feature.Now, what about ZeroTier? Given they posted it to their twitter? Well, it worked. it did the inter connect stuff well, and, given bandwidth limitations on a home broadband connection, it was still quite fast.So, the question is, how fast? Well, on my Surface Book on a WiFi connection in the house, behind a Meraki MX64 firewall, connecting to the GodBoxV2 over FTP though ZeroTier, i get the following result:the same download over FTP direct (no ZeroTier) does the following:So, direct over FTP is faster&amp;hellip; in this instance by about 70%, but, over the download, it did get slower (seen it hit 12 at one stage) and because its over WiFi, those are a bit wonky&amp;hellip;I did get one last screen shot:as you can see, the Zerotier network adapter is showing 77.3Mbps, but the main network adapter is showing 80.8Mbps. There would be other traffic there, but if we assume there is nothing but ZeroTier traffic being sent, there is about 5% of an overhead.So, to wrap up: Minio and its distributed storage system over ZeroTier needs more testing. Ideally, all hosts need to be in the same time zone, or at least have the same time&amp;hellip; Will try work on that soon. As for ZeroTier? I am extremely happy with them. Its fast, easy to setup, and easy to configure. What more could you ask for? Oh, and free, unless you need a pro account!",

Some sites wont let you login at all&amp;hellip; Mind you, some sites work grand and don&amp;rsquo;t ask questions&amp;hellip;And the whole idea of multiple modems, to allow you to download things faster, doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for everything&amp;hellip; Anything you download in the browser is single threaded, so its limited to one modem&amp;hellip; you can use use download accelerators, and they do work, but its an extra step, and some sites don&amp;rsquo;t work for that either (MSDN for example).So, i have given up, bit the bullet, and moved to business class broadband from Virgin Media. It&amp;rsquo;s actually cheaper than the two residential lines i had, but it is also slower than the two combined: previously, it was two x 360/36mb/s. Now i am am on a single 400/40mb/s modem. That being said, there are definite advantages: Static IPs pretty much as standard, and option of either one or five (no unbeaten!) Guess which one i went with? Its technically a /29 range, but the first usable IP is given to the modem, which acts as a gateway, so i end up with five usable. Proper business class SLA. Any issues, someone who knows what they are talking about can help Phone lines on a separate modem. So, i got phone lines with them, and they give a separate modem for those lines, so as not to interfere with the internet. that modem has no internet connection and is just for calls. They are also working on a VoIP/SIP offering, which is something i am interested in. Guaranteed speed! They guarantee a minimum speed to the modem at all time. Business customers have a priority on the network, which is nice. And, during testing, so far, i am getting the advertised speed most of the time. I needed to download a Windows 10 ISO yesterday from the MSDN, and it came in at between 45 and 48MBytes/s!  So, only had it installed a week, and so far, so good. I have one IP given to my PFSesne box, and the rest given to a VyOS VM. The plan is to use the VyOS box for all network traffic, but first i need to do some testing and learning&amp;hellip; Expect some posts on this soon!",

Even though this is a wind up of the project, there are still new things i have to share. I found another project that has potential for speeding up the internet: VTrunkd. after some testing, i does seem to manage to speed up the connection, but either limits on hardware i have in house, or limits of hardware in the cloud, or even the software, stopped me in my tracks&amp;hellip; i did see 400mb/s out of it at one stage, using 200mb/s from each modem&amp;hellip; its close, but its not the full 720&amp;hellip; messing with Quagga/Zebra as mentioned in the previous post has been, well, interesting&amp;hellip; I did manage to get all OVH traffic sent though their server, Digital Ocean traffic sent over that box, and everything else over Hetzner. I added an Azure box to the mix for a while, aswell as a Vultr box, but it got very messey, very quickly. if i had something automated, it would be better. the idea of having a /29 IP range in Hetzner and forwarding it though the tunnels back to the house did work. My Meraki MX64 had one IP address, i had a mail server on a second, everything else on a third, and was planning on using more&amp;hellip; but its just, well, again, messy. So, i will be going back to the idea of 2 IP addresses, and hoping whatever i put infront of the network can figure stuff out&amp;hellip;  So, what am i moving to? well, thats a question&amp;hellip; Currently, i have the Meraki MX64 plugged directly into the modems, and protecting my LAN. So far, so good, but due to hardware limits, it maxes out at around 260mb/s. So, thats out of the question for the main network! I did at one stage have Sophos UTM Home edition running. Sophos also have their XG firewall available for home use, so i might try that&amp;hellip; There is also PFSense which i used before also&amp;hellip; And there may be more&amp;hellip; Maybe there will be a new series reviewing these home firewalls? we will see&amp;hellip;",

There are 2 Meraki MS220-8 switches next. GodBox1 and Godbox2 both connect in here, and are bonded, as is everything else on the network. The MS220-8 has 8 GigE ports, but also has 2 SFP ports. I bought 4 SFP Ethernet adapters and have a short calbe running between the switches. That uplink is also bonded. All going well so far! All meraki hardware can be managed though the meraki dashboard. check out their site for more details and examples of how to use it. I bought one of the MS220&amp;rsquo;s from ebay a few months back, and loved it. Then i realized that you can get your hands on free gear, the MX64, an MS220 and a Wifi Access point if you attend their webinars. Terms and conditions apply, but check them out! I have 2 Ubiquiti UniFi APs, one in the front of the house, one in the back. They are connected to one of the MS220&amp;rsquo;s, but dont work with its POE (maybe the EdgeRouter could do that, since its POE&amp;hellip;) so there are injectors for them. Anyway, the network ports on there are VLANed to the MX64 (more on that later) and the detault traffic is going to a management VLAN. The MX64 has a static internal IP on my DMZ network, and uses the Proliant as an upstream connection. Upstream on the Hetzner server, all traffic coming from the MX64 ip uses one of my /29 ip block. all traffic to that ip is also forwarded directly to the MX64. I has 2 small, unmanaged switches (a cheap 8 port Linksys and a 8 port TP Link) which are used for seperate things: the Linksys has 4 Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s, which run a [GlusterFS] cluster, plugged into it and the TP Link connects to my printers. I also have a Mikrotik CRS226-24G-2S+IN which has 2 10Gbit SFP+ Ports, and plan on using this for higher speed networking soon, aswell as a Cisco 48 port 3560 which also has 4 SFP ports (GigE) and may come in handy for something soon&amp;hellip;  So, thats the network currently. any questions, please leave a comment.",

I also got 2 extra standard IPs and a /29 (8 IPs, 6 usable). I will explain that next. I installed Debian 8.4 on the first disk, and I am planning on using the other 3 for storage of some sort.

One of my IPs in pointing directly at my Meraki MX64 in house (a post on the Meraki stuff is coming, eventually&amp;hellip;) and another at the Proliant box, and I plan on pointing other IPs at machines in the DMZ or a firewall of some sort. the /29 is routed though the IP pointing at the Proliant, so that makes life easier. The original IP is only used for SSH and OVPN from the house. it should not do much else. All network traffic in house is coming from other of the other IPs.Again, so far, so good.

First, as mentioned in the previous post I have MPTCP, Squid, Socks Servers, OpenVPN and IPTables doing their magic. 2 OpenVPN tunnels between the house and Digital Ocean. All TCP Traffic (bar port 80) is sent over socks to the box in the cloud using RedSocks. All UDP traffic is sent direct over OpenVPN. Since MPTCP is in the mix, all socks traffic is actually split over the 2 connections. All port 80 traffic, and 443 (if the client is using local Squid as their proxy) is sent round-robin between the 2 upstream IPs to Squid (2 OpenVPN end points).Things I have noticed: Every now and again, RedSocks crashes&amp;hellip; just full on dies. It’s just a matter of starting again, but it’s a pain&amp;hellip; I have had to restart squid a couple of times&amp;hellip; not too often though there was a power outage in the house a few days back&amp;hellip; so, when everything came back online, it was a bit of a pain bringing all connections back to life. I do have to figure out a better plan  I still have to read more on this ECMP stuff. Hopefully it will do what I am hoping.Now for the theoretical stuff. I started thinking, could this work outside the house? Could you build this into something smaller, like a Raspberry Pi, and stick 2 or more USB Modems in, connect it back to a server in the cloud, setup P2P OpenVPN connections and then get more than a single modem speed download? The problems I can see are around MPTCP. I am not sure if it has been ported to ARM to run on a Raspberry Pi. Second, the max you could ever get out of it is 100Mbit/s, given the 10/100mb network port on board&amp;hellip; and you may need extra power for the USB dongles. Also, getting P2P connections may be complicated, given the non-static IPs on the modems, though, in theory, non-P2P OpenVPN could work&amp;hellip; Again, it’s a theory.

In Part 2 I did some basic testing of both MPTCP and MLVPN. I also mentioned trying MMPPP using vtund but it has been a while since I did that testing, and it had not been on bare metal. So, this post is a follow up, where I am using bare metal.So, first, the setup: ProLiant box is running Debian 8.3 x64, and has both vtund and ppp installed Digtial Ocean box also has Debian 8.3, vtund and ppp installed walked though the guide from John Lewis and made some changes to the configs. the main ones are mentioned below  Once done, i installed both iperf and iftop on both boxes, and raniperf -s  on the Digital Ocean box andiperf -c 192.168.10.1 -d  on the local box. And, well, the results where not as expected. Pretty poor actually:First, using Squid installed on the DO box, i tried using WGET to download a file using it. If I did this on the DO box itself, i was getting 100MBytes/s&amp;hellip; When I ran it over the MLPPP box, well, under 7 was achieved.Then i though it might have been Squid. So, since the file had been downloaded to DO, i SFTPed into the box over the MLPPP link, and tried again&amp;hellip; Again, pretty poor result. I think i seen it hit about 7MB a sec at one stage.Here is what is showing on the DO box when running the SFTP download. You can see 2 connections from the 2 WAN links at home hitting the box, and they are balanced. Its just nowhere near the speed they are capable of.I did not get a screen shot of this, but when I tried with iperf, thinking it might have been overhead of SFTP or Squid, I was getting results matching what I was seeing with SFTP. Downloads in the 55-60mbit/s range for download and 40ish for upload. 40 is still faster than 1 link, mind you&amp;hellip;I mentioned that I had made some minor tweaks to the configs from what John had written. Well, mostly it was config changes to how routing was done. In Johns case, he is bonding a DSL and a HSDPA connection, so he had setup to do for logging into his PPP modem and connecting. Also, when he setup the interfaces, he routing tables in there. I have mine setup in a single config file, like as follows: I have changed the names from adsl1 and 2 to WAN1 and 2, and the IPs are changed from internal IPs to my public IPs. I manually run this when setting up my connection.Nothing else on his config files have changed. I did not do any of the masquerading stuff, mainly cause this was testing. I just want a tunnel to start with. When reading the vtund.conf file, you can see that encryption and compression are both turned off, and and the same in the ppp configuration. I also don&amp;rsquo;t think the issue is to do with the CPU performance, since these are the screenshots of top running on both boxes:in both cases, CPU usage is sub 6% for VTUN and SSH seems to be using less than 10%. So, now, I&amp;rsquo;m baffled as to why this is not performing as expected&amp;hellip; More testing required![update 4/4/2016] - fixing images so they are clickable&amp;hellip;",

The rest can be found here.In my previous post I explained what i was trying to do&amp;hellip; This post explains what i have been working on recently, and performance results&amp;hellip; So, first, what have i tried&amp;hellip; There are 3 different things i have tried, and here are some of their details. Some will need to be updated (other parts of this series), and others i will try get back to eventually.Hardware and servers used To test this, i am using my HP Proliant ML110 G5 running either Ubuntu or Debian Linux, with 2 GigE connections directly to the cable modems, and 1 connection to the LAN (for SSH and testing). The LAN has no gateway set, and the 2 WAN connections have DHCP enabled. They get fully public IP addresses. Upstream, I am using either Digital Ocean or ScaleWay VPS boxes.Digital Ocean has the advantage of allowing different Kernels, so i have been using them for testing MPTCP. As for ScaleWay, well, their BareMetal C2S/M/L boxes have between 4 and 8 cores (4 for the S, 8 for the M and L) and between 8 and 32Gb RAM (S=8, M=16, L=32GB). The L model also comes with 256GB SSD (plus the boot disk, which seems to be a network disk of some sort) and they all come with lots of bandwidth (i use the L because its got about 800MBit/s to the internet).Ping wise, Digital Ocean is about 20-30ms away from the house (I picked London to host the servers) and Scaleway is a little further at about 50ms (They are based in France).MPTCP (MultiPath TCP) MPTCP (their site is a bit wonky as of writing, so bare with me&amp;hellip;) is a Linux Kernel patch that allows TCP connections to use multiple paths&amp;hellip; Essentially, if you have Wifi and 4G in a phone, and MPTCP is enabled, it should allow you to use both connections for TCP traffic, as long as the server upstream supports it. It also allows for easy fail over if, say, you lose your wifi connection. There is an example video of it on YouTube which should show the fail over parts and this video shows how they managed to get 50Gbit/s out of a 6 10Gb Ethernet connections.When i was using MPTCP, I had a copy of Squid on both boxes, and told Squid locally to use Squid on the upstream box (over a SSH tunnel, which was over the MPTCP link) as a parent cache. Using this method, i could see (using iftop) that both connections were being used. When trying proper performace testing, I setup a RAM disk on both machines and copied a Linux ISO to the Digtial Ocean Box. Then, using wget and Axel I downloaded the files using Nginx on the server, and checked the results. I can max out 1 single connection, plus use about 60-80mbit/s from the second. about 420-440mbit/s total. Disk was not the bottleneck, since I was writing to RAM, so more tests are required.MLVPN MLVPN is a pretty interesting project that caught my eye. The idea is quite simple: you configure the local box and server, as mentioned in their example guide and run the MLVPN program on the server, then the client. It creates 2 VPN tunnels between the 2 boxes, and bonds them&amp;hellip; In my case, i was given an IP of 10.42.42.1 on my box in house and 10.42.42.2 on the server. Any traffic over that tunnel is bonded&amp;hellip; Problem is, it seems to be quite processor intensive: my Digital Ocean box was showing one cpu core (out of 2) maxing out at around 80% and my Proliant in house maxing around the 70% mark&amp;hellip; all while transferring data at around 100mbit/s. I tried iperf and got the following:getting 50mbit/s upload is good, in reality, since in theory my max speed would be 72, without overhead. but 116mb/s down is less than a third the max speed of a single connection. So, I tried just uploads and downloads&amp;hellip;Upload Only (from local machine to server)Download Only (from server to local machine)As you can see, the download speed has increased a little, to 176Mbit/s, but the upload speed is now at over 60MBit/s!Still.. download is as important as upload, and given I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to get it to max out one connection, never mind 2, even more testing is required&amp;hellip;MLPPP (using VTUN) This is one i need to come back to&amp;hellip; Used the guide from John Lewis but was only managing to get about 100Mbit/s&amp;hellip; I was originally using a VM (so disk may have been the issue) and also had the connection behind my EdgeRouter, so it might have been firewall rules causing a slow down. But I do need to come back to this soon&amp;hellip; Watch this space.Conclusions? Well, at the moment, all I can conclude is that there is more testing required. Upload wise, i can somewhat use most of my bandwidth with MLVPN, and I did see promising results with MPTCP. I gave up a bit too early with MLPPP, so more testing is required with that. Also, all tests are using just iperf between boxes. I did use squid with the MPTCP box for a while, but not for proper performance testing. So, even once this is all sorted out, i will need to turn this into a proper &amp;ldquo;router&amp;rdquo; too&amp;hellip; So, conclusion? this was originally meant to be a 2 parter&amp;hellip; now it looks like I will require a lot more parts&amp;hellip; Watch this space&amp;hellip;",

They should be connected to the main switch trunked. 8 may be overkill, but i never do things by half. the PFSEnse VM should be connected to all 3 WAN VlANs (900, 901 and 902) and should also have at least one port to the LAN. There may also be other ports for other internal VLANs.  with the spare processor, i can then add other (small) VMs to this machine.",

I have 2 of these in GodBox 2, and you can get them into a microATX board. There does seem to be some limits with the microatx boards, but hopefully enough searching will find me what i am looking for. Ideally, i want it to take &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; DDR3/4 memory (not SODIMMs like the ASRock one above) and also take enough of them to run 64 or 128Gb of ram (thinking 8 would do the job!). Also, i would like to have 4 GigE ports onboard and 1 management port. 4 onboard is not a hard requirement: If i can get one with 2 ports, i can always get a 4 port card for the PCI-Express slot&amp;hellip; Finally, i would like it to have at least 6 SATA ports and possibly an MSATA port. Thinking Boot off MSATA (Windows Server 2016 Nano Server would be used), 2 SSDs and 4 HDDs. Using Storage Spaces, use the 2 SSDs as &amp;ldquo;Fast&amp;rdquo; storage for the pool.I also think i moved off the idea of 10Gb. I like the idea of it, but given a small 10Gb switch costs upwards of a grand, and the plan is to build a machine for that price, i would prefer a fifth machine and using my existing Cisco 48 port switch and leave 10Gb as a future upgrade.Also, changed from last time round is machine count. Originally i was saying 3-4 machines&amp;hellip; now i am thinking 6-7&amp;hellip; 5-6 of them should be Hyper-V boxes and the last one would be a Media Box.I also think the Synology or SAN requirement is out&amp;hellip; Hyper-V can be setup to do replication between hosts, and with a 4Gb link to the LAN, i think i should be OK. Also, if i have the media box separate, i should be ok there too. I will detail the media center in a later post.So, any suggestions or thoughts on what should and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be looked at?",

Well, biggest reason for all this is currently heat and power usage. We use about 4-6x more electricity than the average house here in Ireland, which means our electricity bill is fairly high. It also means that the lab, which is also my office/bedroom, gets quite warm and uncomfortable during the summer month. There is an Air-Con unit in the room, and, well, that&amp;rsquo;s costing the most on electricity!So, what I got is a basic overview of what I want from the homelab and hopefully in the next post, I will have an idea of what it will look like.. 3-4 machines running a Hyper Visor (HyperV, VMWare ESXi or other). Leaning more towards Hyper-V purely because its what I got currently and its what we use in our main office. each machine should be connected to at least 2 networks: one for storage and migration, one for &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; to the LAN. There may be more VLANs for other networks, but 2 is a start. ideally, 10Gb connections would be nice, but multiple 1Gb connections would also work. shared storage (iSCSI, SMB3, etc) would also be a nice to have, but may bump up the server count (not actually a problem) but would increase power and cooling costs. An off the shelf box, like a Synology could do the job&amp;hellip; Lower power usage and less heat produced is also a major requirement. Most of the boxes I am decommissioning are older Xeon hardware (5000 series upto a 5200 series process and even an older Xeon P4!). The newer Xeon E3 and the even newer Xeon D are a lot more efficient, use less power, produce less heat and are way faster than what I currently have. The E3 can use up to 32Gb of RAM and the Xeon D top out at 128Gb&amp;hellip; Me being me would like more than 32Gb RAM&amp;hellip; :) smaller machines would also be nice. I have been looking at both Xeon D and Xeon E3 Mini-ITX boards and cases for them. I do have a half height Dell Rack, which I host these machines, and ideally, these machines should be rack mountable, but micro ATX cases could work. 2 per shelf would work grand. Onboard IPMI and KVM support is something I want too&amp;hellip; I do have a KVMoIP switch in the house, and it works, most of the time, but getting a box that has this embedded into the board would be ideal&amp;hellip; A lot of the server boards had it as standard or allowed it to be speced, so that&amp;rsquo;s all good. I am also thinking of upgrading the router to a similar spec board&amp;hellip; Possibly a Xeon E3, or even an i5&amp;hellip;. Ideally it should have IPMI and KVMoIP on board and should produce less heat. Biggest issues is getting enough network cards into the box&amp;hellip;  These are my requirements at a high level overview. Over time things may change, but lets see how we get on&amp;hellip;",

It has a quad core Xeon, 32Gb ram, 3x3Tb hdds, RAID controller and KVMoIP. one of the first thing i did was get myself a /29 IP pool (8 total, 6 usable IPs). There where already 3 IPs given to me: 1 for the KVM, one for the box itself, and 1 as the router for the IP block.So, i need to setup my own router, so i picked PFSense since its what i run in house. I gave it 2 network connections: 1 connected to the main network adapter on the VMWare ESXi box (public) and one to a virtual switch, which is only used by VMs. The public is the WAN link and it gets a static IP from Hetzner, and the virtual switch is then my &amp;ldquo;LAN&amp;rdquo; link. This allows me to have standard NATed network connections to any VM i have, but then, what do i do with those IPs?So, after a lot of digging, i found the answer. So, this should help. Under firewall, click on Virtual IPs. click the plus. I then selected IP alias, selected the WAN interface and set the IP to my first public IP i wanted to give. in my case, i was given a /29 block, and my first address was 176. This is the network address. I used 177. Likewise, my last address is 183, but that cannot be used either as its a broadcast address. give it a description and then hit OK. Repease for all IPs you want to use. TIP: Give each a meaningful description! Next, click firewall, NAT and 1:1. Click the add button and select your interface as WAN. set the External Subnet IP as the one you want to use and your internal IP as the machine that will have it. Thats all i did on that screen&amp;hellip; Then go to Firewall, NAT, outbound&amp;hellip; this is where things got complicated. Set the mode to &amp;ldquo;Manual outbound NAT rule generation (AON - Advanced Outbound NAT)&amp;rdquo; and click save. Then create a new rule: Interface: WAN, Source, Network, IP of the internal machine and then under translation, under address select the IP you want to give it. If you followed my tip in step 2, you should see the descriptions in here.  After saving everything and reloading the firewall, visiting a page like WhatsMyIP or ICanHazIP should show you your public IP. You can then create firewall rules to allow access. Quick idea would be:Firewall/Rules, Add, Interface WAN, Destination: Local IP you want to use, and give whatever &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; rules you would (HTTP, lock down to source address, etc). Click apply and hitting that address using what ever method (SSH, HTTP, etc) should work.YMMV, but hopefully this helps! Any questions, leave a comment.",

So, i set it up in the house and all was good.Thing is, the wifi in the house was grand previously. I have a Routerboard RB951G which does the job and has no issues. And because i am mostly offsite in the office i work, and because i need to remotely manage the network, the MR18 is going into the office from tomorrow morning. I may talk about the MR18 and the rest of the Meraki gear later on, but this is not that post. This post is about something the MR18 did, and i wanted to do on the RB951.So, the MR18 allows you to create multiple Wifi SSIDs, each with different encryption and security and can use different VLANs. Now, the Mikrotik does the same, but the VLANs stuff is not that easy to figure out. but essentially, what i needed to do was as follows:create your new wifi SSIDs:/interface wireless add master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan1.10 ssid=vlan10 add master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan1.20 ssid=vlan20  next, create your vlans. these need to be connected back to your main ethernet connection. In the case of my RB951, there are 5 ethernet ports. 1 is the gateway back to my Cisco switch and on to my PFSense router. 2-5 are all slaves of number 1, which is a master. So, 1 is essentially a trunk network. So, vlans are created on that./interface vlan add name=vlan10 interface=ether1-gateway name=ether1.10 vlan-id=10 add name=vlan20 interface=ether1-gateway name=ether1.20 vlan-id=20  next, a bridge to connect them/interface bridge add name=vlan10 add name=vlan20  and connect them to the bridge/interface bridge port add bridge=vlan10 interface ether1.10 add bridge=vlan10 interface wlan1.10 add bridge=vlan20 interface ether1.20 add bridge=vlan20 interface wlan1.20  And thats all i needed to do. I have a Sophos UTM Home edition running on a vm for testing, which vlan10 is connected to. It has an upstream connection back to the PFSense box, which has it firewalled off and allows it outside the network, not nothing else. I am planning on doing this with other firewalls, just to do some testing with. This allows me to connect my phone or laptop, or any other wifi device, to a given wifi connection and then be on my way. I also have an older Dell PowerConnect switch, which, if i ever get around to it, will have multiple connections back to the Cisco and then allow physical devices to connect to different vlans.Any questions, comments, etc, leave a comment blow.",

From their website:What is it?Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup. Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server.The duplicity package also includes the rdiffdir utility. Rdiffdir is an extension of librsync&amp;rsquo;s rdiff to directories&amp;mdash;it can be used to produce signatures and deltas of directories as well as regular files. These signatures and deltas are in GNU tar format.So, how do we get it working? Well, givin that i am on Ubuntu, these are the steps i needed to do: first, we need some credentials and API keys&amp;hellip; If you havent signed up for HubiC Do so now&amp;hellip; That url gets you an extra 5Gb if you sign up for free (usually 25Gb) or if you pay 1EUR a month, you get 110Gb (usually 100Gb) and 5EUR a month gets you a staggering 10TB (yup! Terabytes!). Login to Hubic, and in the menu go to &amp;lsquo;My Account&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Developers&amp;rsquo;. in here, create a new application (name and URL to redirect to&amp;hellip; http://localhost seems to work correctly). Get the Client ID and Secret ID that was given to you. take the contents of the following gist and replace your own details&amp;hellip; I know, i am not a fan of sticking my password in a txt file&amp;hellip; but it should be your local machine&amp;hellip; that file should be in your home directory and should be called .hubic_credentials. add the duplicity PPA project (https://launchpad.net/~duplicity-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) to ubuntu using the add-apt-repository command (details on the link above, under the link &amp;lsquo;read about installing&amp;rsquo;). for me, i just called &amp;lsquo;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:duplicity-team/ppa&amp;rsquo; install duplicity by doing &amp;lsquo;sudo apt-get install duplicity&amp;rsquo;. Dont forget (its in the tutorial above!) to do an &amp;lsquo;sudo apt-get update&amp;rsquo; first! When i ran that, there where a few extra Python packages to be installed, so i was asked did i want to install them&amp;hellip; Say, yes. Now, to run a backup we run the following command:  duplicity ~/ cf+hubic://location  cf+hubic is the backend to use, ~/ is the url to backup (my home directory in this case) and location is where on Hubic we want it stored. If this doesent exist, not a problem&amp;hellip; it will create it. after we run this we&amp;hellip; ahhh&amp;hellip; i get an error: BackendException: This backend requires the pyrax library available from Rackspace. right&amp;hellip; pyrax library is from Rackspace and is available to download though pip&amp;hellip; I seem to have python and a few other bits installed on this machine, so running &amp;lsquo;sudo pip install pyrax&amp;rsquo; works&amp;hellip; Your millage may vary&amp;hellip; [eg, this is out of scope for this tutorial! your on your own!] Other problem&amp;hellip; I got a load of weird and wondering errors like this:  AttributeError: &#39;Module_six_moves_urllib_parse&#39; object has no attribute &#39;SplitResult&#39;  I fixed these by running:   sudo pip install furl --upgrade  FINALLY! ITS ALIVE!!! by default, it asks you for a key for the GnuPG encryption&amp;hellip; and its all good! the first backup creates the directories, required files, etc. the next time you run the command, it will only upload changes. it will also ask for your GnuPG code you entered, so remember it!  And thats all folks! Any questions, leave them in the comments!",

May replace it with something more powerfull eventually&amp;hellip; Mouse: Microsoft Arc Mouse. Small, light, foldable and works perfect for what i need it for. Memory card Reader: Lexar Dual Slot USB 2.0 Memory Card Reader: this is very fast&amp;hellip; Has UDMA support for faster CF and SD cards&amp;hellip; Used mainly for reading memory cards from cameras, but given my project uses a Raspberry Pi, and i have 2 of these, one in my main bag is handy. Camera: I carry my a Samsung Galaxy Camera with me at all times. This is my new years resolution and its something that i handy to have with me. Taking photos of notes, videos of lectures, etc, is handy&amp;hellip;. and given its a full Android device, i can send and read emails, tweets, facebook, etc. MISC: I have a small USB Hub pictured (no link, dont know where i got it). I also have all the required cables (iPhone, mini and micro usb, power, etc) and what ever else is needed to run the whole show&amp;hellip;  I am hoping that if i manage to build the Ultimate Mobile HotSpot with a Raspberry Pi, I can get rid of a few things (mobile hotspot, battery charger, replace the iPhone with an iPod Touch) and maybe a lot of cables&amp;hellip; Ideally, the Ultimate Mobile Hotspot should have enough power to charge other devices, and be charged while running also&amp;hellip; but thats another post for another day&amp;hellip;",

What i am thinking is as follows: Have a device, that is small enough to fit in a bag, possibly small enough to fit in a jacket pocket. It will probably not be as small as the iPhone. It should have storage on board. Boot storage and cache storage At least 1, possibly more, WiFi Adapters, with optional antennas At least 1, possibly more, 3G or 4G Modems At least 1 ethernet port, again possibility for more Battery that can run the whole system for at least 4-5 hours, and should be able to run while being charged. charging via USB would be ideal also Optional Screen, but more likley, some sort of web interface to show whats going on (Bandwdith usage, clients connected, connection details)  When this turns on, it should automatically start the 3/4G connections (if there are multiple connections, it should do some balancing of the connections). if there are more then 1 WiFi Connection, one should be a Client (connect to an external WiFi connection, like home, college, work) and one should be an Access Point (Your Phone, Tablet and Laptop connect to this one). Ethernet can also be used in a simular way (if one only, it could be client or server, if multiple, one can be client, one can be server). DHCP addresses will be given out on Access Point or Server connections, and on Client connections, DHCP will be accepted.Squid would be installed and listen on its usual port. Optionally, all port 80 and 8080 traffic could be routed though Squid. Ideally, HTTPS traffic should be automatically routed, but i think thats a bit harder to setup&amp;hellip; If VPN Clients are enabled, it could also allow All or Some traffic to be routed over the VPN connections. SSH could also be used to compress traffic between multiple Squid boxes (one in house, one on the device). WANProxy could be used in a simular manner to save bandwdith and make the connection faster.So, with all that, i am looking at using a Raspberry Pi for the job. I am still working on this, but here is what i have so far&amp;hellip; I have put a Wifi adapter into my Raspberry Pi (A Linksys, but forget the exact model number). Using a tutorial on Vivek&amp;rsquo;s blog on making a wifi hotspot on linux i managed to get the AP showing up on my laptop, but could not connect. I am not sure if its the adapter causing the problem, or what, but i am going to change out the adapter. At the moment, i am sharing the ethernet connection, not the 3G connection&amp;hellip; I have posted here before the link to Terence Eden&amp;rsquo;s post on getting the Raspberry Pi to connect to 3G. All that i will need to do is connect to 3g and then NAT the connection from Wifi to 3G&amp;hellip;  So, there are a few more bits and pieces to get done over the next while&amp;hellip; I will keep posting here&amp;hellip;",

Well, CrashPlan is all good, but there are 2 &amp;ldquo;niggly&amp;rdquo; bits with it&amp;hellip; Its not FREE (well, this year i got it Free on Black Friday&amp;hellip;) but it is cheap ($120 a year to backup 10 machines to the cloud aint bad.) Its NOT FAST! The CrashPlan Datacenters all live in the US, and my servers live in Europe (either Dublin or Germany). So, bandwidth is limited&amp;hellip; Getting less than 1Mbit/s most times, but have seen it reach 3&amp;hellip; I have 20Mbits/s upload&amp;hellip; even half that would be nice&amp;hellip;  So, thats where Symform comes in. Symform is a P2P Backup Service, which runs on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. In theory, it should run anywhere that has a Mono runtime since its written in .NET. Anyway, you start with 10Gb of free storage, and you can increese that by one of 2 ways: Pay money: for $0.15 per month, you get 1Gb of storage in the cloud Pay Bytes: For every 2Gb &amp;ldquo;Contributed&amp;rdquo; (which is actually more like a pledge than a contribution&amp;hellip; more on that later) you get 1Gb storage in the cloud.  It works very well, and is nice a fast too. I have a few machines in house which are contribting stoage, a total of about 2Tb, and I have been given 1Tb storage in &amp;ldquo;The Cloud&amp;rdquo;. There is a lot more on how this works on their &amp;ldquo;How Symform Works&amp;rdquo; section of their site.I mentioned the &amp;ldquo;Contribution&amp;rdquo; VS &amp;ldquo;Pledge&amp;rdquo; up above&amp;hellip; I have a machine in the house where i have Pledged 1Tb of storage. In reality, Symform can use the full 1Tb of storage, if it needs to, but is currently only using 168Gb. Now, that could just be that the machine is still getting files, and it will end up using the full 1Tb eventually, but either way, its all good.Also, as a couple of notes on Contribution and Backups: The machine needs to be online and accessable on the internet at least 80% of the time, but 24&amp;frasl;7 is ideal. If you drop below the 80%, your account can be suspended. your machine needs to be publically accessable, meaning port forwarded. I have a couple contribution machines in house, so they each have seperate ports forwarded to them. Given the P2P nature of the software, lots of connections to different machines are made&amp;hellip; if you are behind a firewall, you may need to allow all or most outgoing connections. If you are on a really restrictive firewall, you may want to stick a contribution box in your DMZ and probably use the Turbo Seeding feature. Turbo Seeding is a handy feature, especially for Laptops&amp;hellip; only problem is its Windows Only&amp;hellip; So, importing and exporting does not work on Linux or OSX. The software can managed Work and Non Work hours, and will limit the upload and download speed during this time. Also a nice feature&amp;hellip;  So far, so good. Very happy with the software, but would like a nicer interface to see whats going on. At the moment, you are either limited to using the web interface, which aint bad, but not great, or watching the log files&amp;hellip; I would also like the ability to prioritize certain files or folders, so, for example, upload my documents folder before anything else, and if anything changes in there, even if its uploading from somewhere else, pause and upload the documents folder&amp;hellip; Just a thought&amp;hellip;",

In it i included a block of Powershell code to bulk convert TV shows from whatever format you had them in to a M4V format for the AppleTV. Well, as they say &amp;ldquo;If necessity is the mother of all invension, lazyness must be the father&amp;rdquo;. I have a lot of shows i wanted converted to the AppleTV, so i built something&amp;hellip; Its called HandBrake Cluster and is written in .NET 4.5, uses MSMQ and Handbrake to do the processing&amp;hellip; The workflow is as follows: setup the system as described on the HandBrake Cluster site. run the adder program with the paramaters required (location of files you want converted, type of files to find, where you want the files to be placed, output file type) run the cluster EXE on as many machines as you want. each machine will need to point to the correct MSMQ on the head node, have their own copy of Handbrake, and must have access to the fileshare that you are reading and writing to&amp;hellip; each node will take a message of the queue, process the file and then mark it as completed. There is code to see if the message has failed, so, in theory, if something goes into the queue, it should always be processed&amp;hellip;  I have run this at home on a couple of different machines, and so far so good&amp;hellip; my room gets a bit warmer when i kick this off, and between the 3 machines i ran it on, my FPS count went from just 80-120 on the Godbox, to a total of about 160 - 240 FPS (Godbox = 80-120, Server 1 and 2 are about 40-60FPS).The next thing i managed to do was tweak my import process for iTunes. I am using a program called iHomeServer for iTunes which is running on the GodBox. It monitors a folder, which is where HandBrake Cluster is writing to, and adds them to iTunes. I can then tweak the metadata using the tool, so i can add art work, tell it which shows are related, and it sets up Art work, title info, etc. It is very handy, and something i am very happy with.",

SipDiscount allows me to set pretty much any number as my Caller ID, as long as i &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; that number (they either text or call you with a code, and you enter it on their site). They also allow me to make cheap calls to Irish Mobiles (check their rates here) SipGate gave me a incoming UK phone number. Its an 0845 number, which I dont know what that means&amp;hellip; but it was free, so its all good. Not sure if i can recieve text messages on it though&amp;hellip; I have a Blueface account, which gives me an Irish 076 VoIP number. 076 is the standard VoIP number here in Ireland&amp;hellip; I have a IpKall number, which is based in Washington State. You need to recieve a call on this line at least once every 30 days to keep it active. My Google Voice accepts calls and forwards them to my IpKall number, which then rings my BlueFace SIP account (since i know they will be up all the time, by my home server may be offline since i am only testing) which, if a SIP device is connected, will forward it again&amp;hellip; if i am offline, or no sip devices are active, that call is redirected to voice mail&amp;hellip;  Its all very complicated at the moment, but the plan will be that any incoming calls should go directly to the machine in house, which will ring the desk phone and any other SIP clients. Any incoming PSTN calls will also do the same. Outgoing calls will depend on the dialing plan, which i still need to figure out, but the theory goes as follows: Irish landline calls at certin times should go though the PSTN (since we get some free calls with our line). Other times they should go though SipDiscount or BlueFace. if the PSTN is busy, fall over to one of the other providers&amp;hellip; Irish Mobile calls should go though SipDiscount and then fall back to land line, or if i ever get the BlueTooth setup working, SipDiscount, then bluetooth, then landline&amp;hellip; International calls should be sent though SipDiscount or Blueface, whichever is cheaper&amp;hellip;  Its going to be an interesting setup&amp;hellip; :)",

But one thing you may need to do is setup VPN connections&amp;hellip; Here are some tips on how to create a VPN Server and Client on your RouterBoard.Client Setup to setup a client, you need to do the following: What does that all do? the first line creates an l2tp-client interface, pointing at &amp;ldquo;servername&amp;rdquo; with the username and password set. encryption, etc is enabled&amp;hellip; Line 2 then enables the client. Line 3 sets all traffic comming from networkaddress/24 (for example, 192.168.0.1&amp;frasl;24) to be sent though the VPN. any traffic going into networkaddress (same example) is not sent though the VPN. Line 4 creates a gateway, for all addresses (0.0.0.0/0) to use the VPN address. finally, NAT Masquerading is enabled on the VPN interface.there are more advanced things you can set above&amp;hellip; some examples I can think of are as follows: There should be no good reason to limit the amount of VPN connections you have&amp;hellip; in theory, you could have multiple&amp;hellip; for the mangle rule, set the src-address to a single machine in your network. that way, it gets VPN only connections. Also, you could set the dst-address to a single address or network to send only traffic going to a given server though the VPN&amp;hellip; Example would be Netflix US traffic to a US VPN server, BBC iPlayer traffic to a UK VPN, etc. the example above uses L2TP, but PPTP, SSTP and OpenVPN are also available.  Server Setup As mentioned above, L2TP, PPTP, SSTP and OpenVPN servers are available on RouterOs. Details on setting them up are available on MicroTik&amp;rsquo;s Wiki at the following locations: OpenVPN PPTP L2TP SSTP  ",

Very handy. One other tip: Using the -C flag, so your command may look like:ssh yourname@remotemachine -L 3128:remoteMachine:8080 -C  will compress data between you and the SSH server, which for basic web browsing (HTML, CSS, JS) will make things faster, but for stuff like images, etc, may not work so well&amp;hellip; Your Mileage may Vary&amp;hellip;Also, while on the subject of SSH, Linux Journal has an article on Eleven SSH tricks which mentions compression, Encryption Cyphers, X11 Forwarding, Config files and other interesting bits.",
