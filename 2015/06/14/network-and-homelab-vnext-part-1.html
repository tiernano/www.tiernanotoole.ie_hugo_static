      <p>So, its that time again&hellip; <a href="http://tiernanotoole.ie/Computers">HomeLab</a> upgrade time&hellip; Or at least the planning for it. I am in the process of rebuilding my home lab, which involves pull all old servers out of the rack and replacing them with new ones&hellip; It also means rewriting the network, possibly upgrading some existing gear and hopefully getting the whole lot done on a budget of some sort&hellip;</p>

<p>So, why? Well, biggest reason for all this is currently heat and power usage. We use about 4-6x more electricity than the average house here in Ireland, which means our electricity bill is fairly high. It also means that the lab, which is also my office/bedroom, gets quite warm and uncomfortable during the summer month. There is an Air-Con unit in the room, and, well, that&rsquo;s costing the most on electricity!</p>

<p>So, what I got is a basic overview of what I want from the homelab and hopefully in the next post, I will have an idea of what it will look like..</p>

<ul>
<li>3-4 machines running a Hyper Visor (HyperV, VMWare ESXi or other). Leaning more towards Hyper-V purely because its what I got currently and its what we use in our main office.</li>
<li>each machine should be connected to at least 2 networks: one for storage and migration, one for &ldquo;public&rdquo; to the LAN. There may be more VLANs for other networks, but 2 is a start.</li>
<li>ideally, 10Gb connections would be nice, but multiple 1Gb connections would also work.</li>
<li>shared storage (iSCSI, SMB3, etc) would also be a nice to have, but may bump up the server count (not actually a problem) but would increase power and cooling costs. An off the shelf box, like a <a href="http://www.synology.com">Synology</a> could do the job&hellip;</li>
<li>Lower power usage and less heat produced is also a major requirement. Most of the boxes I am decommissioning are older Xeon hardware (<a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/family/28144/Intel-Xeon-Processor-5000-Sequence#@All">5000</a> series upto a <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/series/33092/Intel-Xeon-Processor-5200-Series#@All">5200</a> series process and even an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon#Netburst-based_Xeon">older Xeon P4</a>!). The newer <a href="http://www.intel.ie/content/www/ie/en/processors/xeon/xeon-processor-e3-family.html">Xeon E3</a> and the even newer <a href="http://www.intel.ie/content/www/ie/en/processors/xeon/xeon-processor-d-family.html">Xeon D</a> are a lot more efficient, use less power, produce less heat and are way faster than what I currently have. The E3 can use up to 32Gb of RAM and the Xeon D top out at 128Gb&hellip; Me being me would like more than 32Gb RAM&hellip; :)</li>
<li>smaller machines would also be nice. I have been looking at both Xeon D and Xeon E3 Mini-ITX boards and cases for them. I do have a half height Dell Rack, which I host these machines, and ideally, these machines should be rack mountable, but micro ATX cases could work. 2 per shelf would work grand.</li>
<li>Onboard IPMI and KVM support is something I want too&hellip; I do have a KVMoIP switch in the house, and it works, most of the time, but getting a box that has this embedded into the board would be ideal&hellip; A lot of the server boards had it as standard or allowed it to be speced, so that&rsquo;s all good.</li>
<li>I am also thinking of upgrading the router to a similar spec board&hellip; Possibly a Xeon E3, or even an i5&hellip;. Ideally it should have IPMI and KVMoIP on board and should produce less heat. Biggest issues is getting enough network cards into the box&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>These are my requirements at a  high level overview. Over time things may change, but lets see how we get on&hellip;</p>
